The visionary director manages, through the undaunted and determined flow of fans with the #releasethesnydercut movement, to bring his spectacular vision of the Justice League, presenting a spectacular film with parsimony and dedication, as only a true DC fan can do. Not only the film is deepened with a wealth of filmed material that no one ever imagined existed, but it manages to redeem itself and to fight with tight fists the previous Justice League (2017) which was a total and a colossal flop in every aspect (not Snyder's fault, of course). In this Snyder Cut all the questions that the Theatrical Cut did not give are answered, digging into the background of the characters and giving valid reasons where it seemed everything was thrown into turmoil and even randomly placed; moreover, the full potential of Snyder's direction is…",

It seems he made the ultimate public faux pas: a glaring omission of not thanking his beloved for her undying support. The verbal fireworks are lit in Sam Levinson's two character drama. Malcolm and Marie. However it appears that director/ writer also forgot to thank Edward Albee too.Now if you are planning to do a two person drama, then you best have a script filled with thought-provoking dialog and a duo of actors who know their craft. Kinda to the former, a definite yes to the latter.\nAfter all, words become the action in this scenario. In fact, they matter the most.

The character was so hard to root for that I started to enjoy watching his life become a mess. Good actors are totally wasted and there's massive parts of the movie that are super dumb and have no purpose in furthering the plot. Like the lame scene with the joke that fails and all the homies are shaking their heads. Also the scene at that sketchy apartment when he gets beat up. This movie is so highly rated because all the kids who can't think critically don't want to seem like haters and actually admit the movie sucked.

      "review": "Spiral, the next chapter in a saw franchise that started out so promising under the steady direction of James Wan, but has since resorted to Darren Lynn Bousman again who handled it with much less finesse. The script could've used pretty much a complete overhaul. The dialogue consisted of continuous screaming and cussing for no apparent reason. The camera work was pretty chaotic, I think he used too much shaky cam and maintained a tone that made the movie unenjoyable. You could tell the movie was high budget due to the quality of its set pieces and effects, not to mention the two A list actors. The funny thing is, I think that they were both miscast. I'm sorry, but Chris Rock in this type of movie just didn't do it for me. He was whiny, angry, and his performance lacked the depth I was expecting. As for Samuel L. Jackson, I've never been a big fan of the majority of his performances (Except for Pulp Fiction of course). The kills were pretty inventive, with plenty of gore as Saw fans…",

      "review": "The Father is a difficult film to review. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is not an exploitative trauma film like so many other movies and shows out there right now. In some ways, The Father is the scariest horror film that I have ever seen. You need to be emotionally prepared to watch this film and the Alzheimer's disease reality that it presents. This is not a \"date night\" movie. Schindler's List has more lighthearted moments in it than The Father.Do not let these comments discourage you from watching The Father, though. If you are a fan of cinema and the wide breadth of emotions that it can elicit, The Father is simply a jaw-dropping exposition into the very raw emotions that this disease can, and has, inflicted on countless generations of families, including my own. You will probably not want to re-watch The Father as soon as it is finished, and that is okay. It reminds me of Requiem for a Dream (2000) in that both films are very emotionally powerful, but I was not dying…",

In this film he just went on autopilot after the opening scene, and the other actors look like they're completely asleep. Out of all the auxiliary characters, the kid's mother, the girl at the gas station and the main villain's driver emote the most. Those are barely even speaking roles.It's hard to even call this a movie, since there is barely any plot to the whole thing. Most of the setups go nowhere. Neeson's relationship to his cop friend ends up being pointless filler, his house is burned down after he already chose to leave, he loses his rifle at one scene only to immediately buy another in a scene later. Hardly anything in the film is of consequence. It's basically Neeson and the kid, who share absolutely no chemistry, on a bland road trip and the bad guys slowly gaining on them, because they track his credit card…",

I didn't mind that.\" But then it kept going and going and going. And the longer it went the less relatable and more awful the two leads were revealed to be.The man is an egotistical and pretentious sort who keeps a list of all the favors he does for his girlfriend and holds it over her head when she asks for anything in return. The woman is mentally unstable and verbally abusive, gaslighting and playing the victim in a toxic manipulative way.

Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson return as ghost-hunting supremes Ed and Lorraine Warren who set out to make sense of the case and prove that demons can and do in fact take possession of people whilst convincing the high court that supernatural forces can be used as mitigating circumstances.The formula for the third entry moves away from the haunted house tropes that drove the narrative of the first two films and veers towards the…",

Let's be clear: the production team went all out with this, and money seemingly was no object. But does that make for a good film?

There is nothing I hated, and more importantly, nothing I would change. I would even watch this again sometime in the future! And this a very big ask for a movie.It's funny. This seemed like a cheap indie movie, but the script is so well planned. A yarn that unwraps in the best possible way..... You, whoever you are, can probably tell I'm still excited.\nI would recommend this to anyone that like a good action movie with a bit of sci-fi in it. Has a dash of \"No More Heroes\" the game (the first one, of course), and a tad of Deadpool (the good parts).\n** I loved Guan-Yin and her scenes.. she was one the best parts of the movie. It's this kind of love into a little piece of a whole thing that makes me enjoy cinema as much.",

Surely any movie that expands on the technical prowess and acting chops that the trailer set up will be fantastic! The movie does expand on all of the pieces the trailer introduced - in doing so, \"The Little Things\" takes one step forward, and two steps back. Admittedly, the movie looks good visually; the cinematography is appropriately moody, with dim lighting for the majority of the running time that casts an ominous shadow over its characters.The acting, too, is incredible.

We watched this one on HBO Max and it was pretty darn good! In a serial killer movie that had a lot of feels to it like the movie \"Se7en\", this one didn't disappoint. Denzel is involved with the case because of personal reason, one that has lasted 5 years, and the case has striking similarities to one of his cases. Rami Malek plays the new hot shot with the LAPD and partners up with Denzel to find the killer. Their prime suspect is played by Jared Leto who, quite honestly, steals the show. The suspense and writing make this movie a MUST SEE. Definitely worth watching at least once!",

It is unavoidable for me not to see the similarities in all the ways that it has them, from shots, to structure. Two leads, one older one younger and the only other main characters being the suspect. It has so many parallels like the climax's are eerily similar.It does change Direction in its final act and does something to make it a little more memorable and individual.The acting is fine for the most part so edge slightly to the side of cartoon and feel a little out of place.The poster is gorgeous though, it really sticks in your head so there is a bonus.I don't know it wasn't really anything that I hadn't seen before.

If I pay a ticket to see the film I want the story to be honored: Godzilla has features that we hope to see film after film. I don't ask for much. But the untalented people who made the film came up with the idea that it was better not to play Godzilla's music. I thought of Star Wars without it´s iconic music. It's the same. An aberration. On the other hand, the humanization of King Kong is unbearable. Uncomfortable, worried, it makes it nauseating to see the great King Kong turned smart gorilla who can communicate with his little friend. Since when did King Kong stop liking blondes?

Daniel Kaluuya emulated the necessary leadership and charisma to portray Hampton. My only issue with his casting is that he is in his thirties, while Fred Hampton died at age 21. I think this is really crucial to the story- his assassination at such a young age is not a minor detail. I do appreciate that Akua Njeri (known at the time of the film as Deborah Johnson) and Fred Hampton Jr. were consulted for this film, and I think that is clear. While Bill O'Neal takes the forefront as a double agent, Fred Hampton's character is still highlighted and preserved. The ending was absolutely devastating, particularly the choice to include footage of the real Bill O'Neal. I think this film launches an important conversation about being complicit vs. actively harming someone, especially in the context of the Black Power movement. I also think…",

Anyone with a conscience knows that Disney would never bring this character back to the big screen in 2021 without making some changes, especially regarding this motivation in particular. How would a movie with a dog-killing protagonist at its front and center be remotely successful? Obviously, this hardcore motif no longer belongs to Emma Stone's Cruella's defining character traits, which might be a no-no for those viewers who are more protective of the original material, as if times and culture didn't change from decade to decade.Since the start of Disney's live-action remakes campaign, audiences have been divided about how to feel and what to expect from these films.…",

We all know what the legal and social system is like. He'll claim it's more of the persecution he talked about in the morning announcement segment. Plus, the one girl admitting she tripped the guy who's the Pirate mascot? That's not feminism, that's assault.And what did they do when the girl lost the scholarship? Nothing.

However the plot for without remorse was so far fetched I had to take a moment to process if this was a satire. To think a navy seal could just murder a foreign dignitary at the airport in front of everyone and one.. not be shot and two just not have immense press coverage and absolutely zero chance of being released from jail for a goose chase. But the worst thing of all in this movie is how the CIA is portrayed. Tom Clancy made his fortune off of writing about the CIA.. has anyone heard of jack ryan?

With beloved actors Daniel Kaluuya and Lakeith Stanfield and a healthy distribution from HBO Max backing the project up, this film is surely to be a contender for the eventual 2021 oscars. So what makes this film worthy of not only critical appraisal, but also Kaluuya's Screen Actor Guild award?As the film depicts the rise and fall of revolutionary activist Fred Hampton (Kaluuya), what makes the film striking is how it presents all these details in a powerfully bold manner. Not unlike the movements from Malcolm X or Bobby Seale, the way Hampton struck fear and determination through his brash speeches allowed the movements for racial justice to grow bigger and bigger over the years. Considering just how many enemies Hampton had on…",

Everyday people surviving a pack of ordinary sharks, not super-enhanced, not vengeful, nothing like the Deep Blue Sea or Jaws IV, or Meg, whatever.My guess is that they were aiming at a more grounded approach, and it worked ok until a certain point. I think that real sharks probably wouldn't jump out of the water and intercept you mid-air in a bloody fashion, but this kinda takes away the interest from the film. They provide a bare minimum of information about the characters, but this is still a killer shark film and you expect something different from the very basic and tired concept.My biggest problem with it was that up until 50! Minutes into the film, nothing really happens, they just wrap up the set-up. There is also a very awkward racial or ethnic conflict which I did not understand at all, it just felt super forced.It's not spectacular, it's not gory and fun, it's not original in any way, so while I can say that it was…",

Impeccable gowns and hairstyling add to the glamor and realism of the music being sung so beautifully by her swingin, emotional voice. Day expresses a lot in those eyes tender one minute and giving diva the next.

As he gets to the border in Arizona,we get to see the cartel pursues the young boy as the latter gets to land in the US.The movie was definitely serviceable at best. No question that Liam Neeson delivers as Jim - the marksman - which is enough to make it entertaining. Also, we get to see him morphing into the new Clint Eastwood.

Anne struggles to find an aid who can handle her father, so that she can get on with her life. Zeller shared that his inspiration for the film was watching his grandmother, who raised him, pass away from dementia. You can feel the emotion coming through every part of the film.The movie starts with Anne confronting Anthony for chasing off the last assistant. Anthony claims he did it because she stole his watch.

There are cringe inducing moments, unfitting musical choices, and awkward acting performances, but a decent plot, beautiful scenery, and a well crafted script keeps this flick about family and cultural heritage afloat.Certainly a movie to be enjoyed with the family and a bowl of popcorn.",

Frank Lammers as Ferry and Elise Schaap as Daniëlle carry most of the movie. As we will see how their romance started.Ferry is the right hand of a rich Amsterdam based drug criminal Brink (Huub Stapel). After they get robbed by other criminals, an ordeal that goes bad. Brink sends Ferry to his home region Brabant to take care of matters and have their revenge. We see that this will change Ferry's life. Some thing he could not have expected to happen.On the downside i missed a bit in character development. Some of the dialogue and interaction could use a bit more depth.The pace of the movie on the other hand is on point and will keep you focused. All in all an enjoyable watch!Must-see for those who have seen (and liked) the Netflix series Undercover.Houdoe!",

I believe Judas and the Black Messiah did it justice.Judas and the Black Messiah follows Bill O'Neal, a man who becomes an FBI informant to gain inside information on the Deputy Chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party, Fred Hampton.After watching the first trailer, I got goosebumps. Even after repeat viewings of the trailer, I still got goosebumps. No trailer has made me feel like that before and so I was anticipating this film for a long time. This film was unflinching in its portrayal of its events and I loved every bit of it. It may be a disappointment to some as Fred Hampton isn't in the film as much as you would think but I thought showing this story through the perspective of O'Neal was a great choice. Bill O'Neal was an interesting person who did make choices that were questionable and I liked the conflict that built over time between…",

Being a film critic isn't exactly an easy task, especially when it comes to deal with public opinion. In most cases, when one reaches a high level of success, that always comes with a heavy dose of offensive tweets and personal attacks, particularly when the author's opinion contradicts the audience's response. So, I was hoping that Sam Levinson would not contribute to the dozens of misconceptions surrounding film criticism and hundreds of conspiracy theories regarding journalists of the respective area...Unfortunately, the extremely exaggerated, borderline offensive, over-the-top monologues - kind word for rants - delivered by Malcolm (John David Washington) are simply more wood thrown to the already devastating fire.

It really is a beautiful piece.The actors chosen for each role were arguably perfect. There were a few big celebrities such as Vince Vaughn and Miranda Cosgrove, but most of the people acting in this movie are a part of IC. Keeping it close to home creates a comfortable feeling, while still going big with the known actors.The storyline was less perfect, but definitely still worth watching. There were some moments that you can't help but smile at because it reminds you of your own memories. There was even a scene where I cried- it hit home for me in many ways. Which goes back to relatability. This movie is very much relatable. Every kid who skates thinks about going pro at least once. And many try their luck later on. There is coming of age, drama, and comedy; very versatile and interesting.The best part of the film (for me) by far…",

She even brings Morgan Freeman down several pegs on the acting level. Not good to terrible would be the score I'd give both performances. I don't have a problem with Ruby Rose but she is NO WHERE near the level of acting needed to be much beyond supporting cast. And even then. She's just a CW TV level actress. Even her British accent was poorly executed.In the beginning, Freeman and Rose are best buds but (literally) in a split second they are now enemies or frenemies. I don't even think this movie will make it on the cheesy cable channels.

They found an undisturbed ship buried with a bunch of Anglo-Saxon artifacts. For an archaeologist, that had to have been extremely exciting.

It fills in some reimagined holes in the historic excavation.

We get to meet the rest of the cast now as they get set to record a reality show about survival after the apocalypse. We see how selfish the characters are but the real battle for survival starts when the games begin and the cannibals join in. Larger cast on both sides of the battle helps the film because we get more confliction, more blood and a larger body count. Saying that we do have to get through a whole host are highly unlikable character with the only ones worth supporting are Dale, Mara and Jake. The story gets to poke a small bit at how ridiculous reality television is now. It could have gone for the found footage angle with all the contestants wearing head camera, but it stays well clear which works well for the film. It really comes off as an improvement from the first film storyline wise feeding into the gorier side of the…",

      "review": "\"Cherry 2000\" is a sort of post-apocalyptic science fiction Western, a cross between \"Mad Max\" and \"The Stepford Wives\". The year is 2017, thirty years in the future when the film was made in 1987. Following some unspecified apocalypse America is divided into at least two parts. In the big cities civilisation goes on much as before. The deserts of the American West, however, have become a lawless wilderness, dominated by violent gangs, similar to those in the \"Mad Max\" films, who roam the desert in cars or on motorbikes.The film does not dwell much on futuristic technology, with one exception. The central premise of the film is that, before the apocalypse, science managed to perfect humanoid robots. The main character is a young man named Sam Treadwell who owns a \"Stepford Wives\" type female robot who acts as his housekeeper and sexual partner. As these robots are programmed to have warm and affectionate personalities and never have a headache at bedtime Sam is very happy with this…",

But overall, very entertaining, impressive, and promising for a whole new film category for South Korea to add to. And they have a lot now. Btw, it's nice to see a variety of countries and languages represented here, not just the usual English only which I find more realistic in a sense. Btw, it is very difficult to incorporate so many different languages and it didn't always work out. But I always thought these futuristic space stories had way too many people from only certain countries ie USA and UK. Star Wars are suppose to be aliens, not even human, far far away and they are still mostly....English speaking white people basically. No one ever thought this was odd? Anyways, looking forward to more sci-fi to come out of South Korea, and other countries for that matter",

And frankly, it was. The first half of the movie was well done and fairly realistic. Unfortunately (and here is where we have a bit of a spoiler alert), once the antagonist (and his soon to be brain-dead sheep followers) was fully infused with hyper-testosterone by not taking the specific protocol of medication required for all of the crew members, the film went straight into the garbage bin for me.I mean, did the director really think that teenagers are so completely stupid that they would believe an 'alien' was…",

One small criticism is that Carey Mulligan is too young for the part but she carries it off superbly and the performance by Ralph Fiennes is one of the best I have seen in a long time. The whole cast is superb and the backdrop of imminent war is ever present throughout the film. I have visited Sutton Hoo a number of times and studied the excavation and I still marvel at the work Basil Brown did.

Well, if that movie was made, of a crew that was sent out on a 86 year trip and everything was fine and dandy, what kind of entertainment would that be? Instead, this movie is smart about showing the very core of human nature as it's being introduced in the later development of the young adult mind. Do people reviewing this movie have any clue or evidence of this experiment on humans? No one has, because it's a SCIENCE FICTION MOVIE idea.Even though every part of this movie is a cliche, it still delivers the message of our faults. How just one bad seed can spread fear and devastation, how peer pressure works, common enemy strategy and all other aspects of how every dictator has used their manipulation to drive their hate through people.

Yes, yes it is. The only reason I wrote this review was because I felt I needed to come to this movies defence in the wake of a slew of negative reviews trashing the Falcone McCarthy team. I hope they keep making movies together and I hope they make me laugh like this one did.The only critical comment I have is that this would have made a better TV show than a movie, but it's still worth a watch.

Even worse, the main characters will often hurt people who are entirely innocent and unrelated to the things that they are trying to change. \"Collateral damage\", if you will.The antagonist is less and less evil throughout the movie, and is basically only turns from the rival to the antagonist at the end of the movie because he does something really evil, entirely out of left field.

      "review": "Oxygen, the new trapped room sci-fi thriller on Netflix, does a decent enough job playing with its claustrophobic premise to entertain the audience. For audiences who have seen trapped room movies like Buried, Cube or Panic Room, it is familiar territory.A woman wakes up trapped in an airtight cryogenic pod and discovers the oxygen levels are running low. With no memory of who she was or how she got there and using the online A. I. MILO, she must figure out a way to open the pod before the air runs out.Mélanie Laurent, from Inglourious Basterds, does a great job selling the claustrophobia, peril and eventual paranoia. The central mystery kept me hooked and guessing what was going on. When the final reveal came, I wasn't as surprised as I should have been from my knowledge of genre conventions and there could have been more red herrings emplaced to make me doubt what was going on.The film is directed by Alexander Aja, who directed one of my favorite films from 2019, the alligator…",

Basically, when Sam Treadwell's (Andrews) robotic playmate/best/only female friend 'dies', he desperately needs a replacement. An exact replacement. He braves the wilds out in the desert to reclaim his lost love. How will he find his dream girl? (Spoiler!) By finding another one! Sam hires a Tracker, Edith Johnson, also known as \"E.\". E is a sexy, capable, hard woman (Griffith). Although E is the antithesis of everything Sam held dear, he finds love eventually....just not in the arms he expected.

Perhaps add a scene when they captured their first human and when they began to have a taste for human flesh. But they captured the story-line quite well. 7/10The deformed families acted a bit strange in some is really young, he acts like he hasn't killed before, he has a sister. It seems that there were too many at the same time in different scenes. The girl cannibal who killed Elena acted like she was the husband of the boy cannibal masturbating about Elena. And then later on they have sex, only to realise they are siblings because towards the end of the film, the dad and the mum cannibal seem to be the parents of the boy and girl cannibal.

I was even pretty stoked with Michael B. Jordan's casting. He has the range and depth to bring Clark to life just as well as any of the other actors who have.

      "rating": 8,
      "review": "Girl in the Basement is my latest write-up. It's a brutal experience not a movie and I don't think I could sit through it again. That doesn't mean it's not recommendable.So yeah, \"Basement\" is a Lifetime film on anabolic steroids. It makes other Lifetime endeavors feel like child's play in comparison. The despicable antagonist in \"Basement\" is played by Judd Nelson. If you thought you hated his John Bender in The Breakfast Club, you ain't seen nothing yet.Girl in the Basement is like 2015's Room bucked up about ten notches. And if you're easily upset and/or wholly traumatized, you might wanna stay clear of \"Basement's\" tormented, 88-minute running time.The director of \"Basement\" is actress turned rookie helmer, Elisabeth Rohm (she makes a cameo too). Rohm's debut is impressive as she uses two or three locations and creates a level of claustrophobia and pseudo Stockholm syndrome. Heck, \"Basement\" contains the type of cinematic, family dysfunction that would make Maury Povich eat his heart out.Based loosely on a true story and spanning about twenty years, Girl in the Basement is about a father (Judd Nelson as Don) who holds his youngest daughter captive in his downstairs abode. He abuses her, rapes her, and in disturbing fashion, she ends up mothering three of his children (with one added miscarriage brought on by brute violence).In retrospect, I was almost reluctant to review Girl in the Basement because well, the putrid subject matter punched me in the gut once too often. However, the somewhat happy ending and eventual rendering of the outside world was enough to suffice. \"Basement\" is a Lifetime pic that other Lifetime pics couldn't touch with a stick. It will affect you terribly and make you realize that today's environment although hard up, might not be so hard after all.",

Fred's oratorical scene after being released from prison was some of the most powerful on screen rhetoric since Mel Gibson's \"freedom\" speech in Braveheart.The message of the film was extremely poignant in today's climate without feeling like it was over proselytizing. It was a historical dramatization, nothing more and nothing less.The ending, while it should have been predictable, was nevertheless shocking and disturbing.Really well done overall, a must watch in my opinion.",

I mean, where was his cute and funny charm from the first film? Did someone he love die in between the 2nd and 3rd film? Character relationships didn't seem to be going anywhere and it was like watching paint dry -- no development whatsoever. Peter and Lara's relationship development never got anywhere just like pushing jelly up a hill.The main thing I disliked…",

Plus, I haven't seen much of Arsenio lately. The premise is great in that, Akeem, left a little secret behind in America and it's time to answer that call. So much time passing works well for that premise also. I don't want to give anything away as it's not exactly a thick plot. I will say some of it, plot and jokes, was predictable. Sequels always have that uphill battle. But, overall it did the job and as far as I was concerned, the surprise of it simply showing up after all these years won me over.

From the announcement, to the preview at Camp Flog Gnaw, to the videos and Instagram posts explaining NoHo journey, the build up and hype makes it that much better. Now for the actual film, it was very well shot, with effortless and flowing transitions, Mikey and his team did a phenomenal job on the presentation and boring work to make this film look good.Also, the sets and costumes in this movie and bright and vibrant with the exception of a couple scenes. These choices really help set the mood. Another strong feature is the soundtrack (perhaps its strongest), the ability to have The Chiffons and Baby Keem, fit in the same movie is really a testament to the diversity and range of the film. The story speaks for itself in my opinion. It shows the strains achieving your goals can have on your relationships.

Outstanding work by the director Cecilia Verheyden who also knew exactly what to show to click with the fans of the \"Undercover\" series without letting the new viewers unhooked and lost with references.This film is indeed even more violent than the Undercover series but those moments are necessary to understand the depth of the show based on it as it happens that the show itself lacks background on Ferry, making him in the process an anti hero instead of the criminal you supposed to condemn.Please do not hesitate to watch if you're a newbie in the world of \"Undercover\" and if you are not, this will be your film of the summer.",

While that makes for a believable excuse, given we all like Neeson, the situations get increasingly predictable and dull beyond a point. The action is certainly there but it doesn't form the core of The Marksman. I'd say it's more of a character-driven drama with elements of a road thriller. Strictly speaking, it's standard Liam Neeson fare where only his character undergoes an emotional transition. Nothing, I mean absolutely nothing else really counts here. Is it still watchable? For sure, as is the case with most Liam Neeson flicks. If you've seen any of his work in the last decade, you've seen it all. Only names, settings, and situations change. Also, they really need to stop writing scenes with Neeson on the phone. That's an oversaturated niche in itself.",

Aside from the really stupid story about contestants in a reality-show being killed off one by one by the mutants, its really, really sick, the acting is horrible and gross overkill in almost every scene.The original Wrong Turn was a good little horror movie. It had a good script, good actors, likable characters and the mutants was actually scary.In this one, the mutants are just ridiculous, they can talk, which ruins it completely. The most sickening scenes was a mutantwoman giving birth to a mutantbaby, mutants making out and having sex. Why do we have to see this?? Is this what the audience demands, to be satisfied today?? As for the human characters, that we're supposed to root for did'nt care for any of them. They were all just their to be killed in the most disgusting ways and chopped to pieces and eaten. The Rambo-wannabe character was so unbelievably dumb that I just wish he would die…",

I think they realized that Gen Z loves daydreamy and romantic montages on tiktok, so they decided to put random ones in this movies that are completely unnecessary and don't further the plotline at all. The montage of them traveling and being cute/existing in New York was sooo long. It didn't add anything of value to the movie. I thought this during most scenes.I know that they filmed this movie a while ago. Netflix must have been excited to capitalize on the success of the first movie and filmed the sequels as fast as possible.The closing scene where Lara Jean's dad gets married to Trina and \"Dancing in the Moonlight\" is actually somewhat enjoyable, but that's really the only scene. Also, why did we need three versions of the Beginning Middle End song? Why??Again, great trailer. Really made me think that the movie was going to be watchable. Who edits the trailers anyway?

      "review": "I haven't read Without Remorse, yet considering Amazon started business selling books, why can't the writers of these productions read one if they're going to say it's based on one! Tom Clancy was the master of the techno-thriller, mixing elements of science fiction, political thriller and spy genres, albeit Clancys extensive research helped readers understand foreign militaries and his plots eerily echoed real events to the degree rumours circulated the CIA thought he was a mole.This film has none of his subtlety. Yes, it's normal for books to change when made into a film, but all that seems left of Clancys work are a few names.On the plus side, Jamie Bell does get the sneaky company man role down. His spook demeanour in relation to the other soldiers is probably the most in keeping with Clancy.MBJ makes a decent effort as the lead, who in typical Hollywood fashion is pretty trigger happy, an amazing shot with grenades, but never seems to be in much peril, while Jodie Turner-Smith seems to only be allowed one emotion.On the other side, I'm not sure if Guy Pearce was just tired all the way through, but compared to the usual energy he shows in his other films, he was putting me to sleep.The cinematography is dark at places really hard to see what is going on. I get fighting in the dark adds to the effect, but I ended up watching one of the early fight scenes three times and only found out what had happened later in the film. It shouldn't be that hard.The post credits scene should have filled me with joy, but considering everything I'd just seen, it just left me more sad.",

The biggest issues with this movie is 1) lack of action apart from a few small sections in the movie. And 2) extremely drawn out. The bulk of the movie is Liam with a kid where the dialogue is equal to a highschool play.I got into bed at night thinking I'd have something decent to watch and instead just found myself fast forwarding these scenes just so I can get this movie over with. There's lots more that makes this movie sink in quicksand but that's the main of it. The stereotypical \"bad guy\", the extremely obvious clues and clueless mishaps that always keeps the baddies almost one step ahead and on and on.Do yourself a favor and save yourself and go watch Death WIsh (original) if you want an action movie.",

Kramer, movie critic for 'Salon' ezine, wrote, \" There is a nagging sense that the film should have played up the importance of the Sutton Hoo find more,\" as he faults the movie for concentrating more on the characters than on the archaeology.I disagree with him as I watched this film with questions about life, death, how we live and the choices we make for whatever reasons at the time. As the archaeological find of the Anglo-Saxon burial ship proceeds, we are confronted with the thought that this ancient ship was constructed, then buried, by real people. This plays out against the backdrop of England preparing for what we know will be a horrific war in which millions will be killed. Life in the midst of death, death a presence in every life, and yet we as a people live on.

Beginning is fun when she competes as a little girl and feels like groundwork for the coming story, but then the rest of the movie has nothing to do with the beginning. The mall scene at the beginning is really, really awful! The other fight scenes are just okay but not terrible. The story is pretty bad, but there are far worse. I've never been a fan of the \"superhero loses their powers\" plot line. Steve coming back in someone else's body is super weird. You want him back somehow, but not like that. Cheetah is an interesting idea but they didn't utilize her like they could have. I was expecting an epic matchup between she and Wonder Woman at the end. Not there. If you blink you will miss it. It's just an okay hero movie. It's not great, but better than 1 star.",

The entire movie was filmed in black and white, a visual symbol that speaks volumes, making this movie a piece of modern art. The film is already earning Oscar buzz for the film and the actors...all well deserved.John David Washington plays a filmmaker on the night of his premiere. As a film critic myself, his character's perspective and comments gave me a lot to think about. He and Zendaya's character talk about film, love, relationships, gratitude, politics, and art.THINGS I LIKED:\nThe fact that this movie only has 2 cast members is extremely impressive, especially considering how compelling they are to watch for almost 2 whole hours.\nI'm such a huge fan of John David Washington and thought he was stellar in Blackkklansman.

His words felt like the directors. It was like film school pretentiousness with him constantly talking about certain directors and certain moves and not understanding them like Citizen Kane.The whole shooting on film and in black and white was just done to be artsy in my eyes.

The storyline in this one, we get a group of people filming a reality show which was rather fun and interesting, and I could tell from the opening death a woman sliced in half is that this movie was gonna be awesome. I was a bit sceptical at the reality show setting as in the past when slasher movies have tried this, they usually don't really work, but in this it works to full effect and plus we get more inbred mutants to add to the fun.

      "review": "I'd heard terrible reviews about this going in, but I was certainly in for a pleasant surprise. While the movie does have a few rather predictable scenes, they're mingled with unexpected twists, immensely effective jump scares, and excellent character development. While a few minor characters' acting may be a bit sub-par (which is never the fault of the top billed cast, of course), the raw intensity of Jeffrey Dean Morgan's character more than makes up for it. The CGI doesn't look the best at first, since the initial scene that uses it is in a dream sequence, but after that, it is so realistic that you can scarcely tell that it wasn't done with live actors (it does, however, have an effect around it which serves to make it even more unnatural, which some may find to look bad). A fantastic cast, wonderful direction, great writing, and a terrifying antagonist all work in tandem to make this movie the best horror film I've seen since The Empty Man. It's entertaining, easy to follow, and,…",

The gore and blood effects are so ridiculously stupid. Even worse the movie takes place during the daytime. You can't make a horror movie scary without it taking place at night. I know its been done before, but Wrong Turn 2 doing that. It does NOT work. The thing I hated the most was there were moments where the mutants engaged in \"sexual activity\". That was extremely gross and sick. I wish those parts were deleted. Now don't get me wrong this movie was fun to watch. The acting is great and and there were a few surprises. The only cool thing about Wrong Turn 2 is watching Henry Rollins as retired marine Dale Murphy kicking mutant ass.",

Joe accompanies Jim to a new crime scene and notes some similarities with his unsolved case.Joe takes some personal days and begins to…",

Well I was wrong.There was nothing joyful or quirky about this film. 2 hours of immature back and forth, are we really to believe teenagers still behave like this? And do we really want to sell young women this pretty, rose tinted idea of romance?Peter at no point offered to change college after year 1 to be closer to LJ, putting the onus on LJ to make their relationship work and quite frankly gave the whole story a pretty misogynistic vibes. And that's ignoring everything (aka the hottub scene) that happened in the second film. I missed John Ambrose's character given how much more mature he was and how he treated LJ as an equal.On reflection they should have stopped after the first film.",

The overt and straightforward way that this tackles extremely complex subject matters will definitely not work for some people. But I think the film is definitely aware of this fact, and instead tries to create a more upbeat and simple portrayal of feminism, and in that regard I think it works well. Amy Poehler's direction is solid, the performances are good and the first two acts in particular are pretty enjoyable. I do think the focus should have been more on some of the side characters, who all things considered were much more interesting, but that doesn't mean that the lead character's arc wasn't pretty strong. It is a bit too long for its own good, and again oversimplifies a complicated topic, but I'd be lying if I didn't say that I had a smile on my face when the credits started to roll. Overall, it's an uplifting and enjoyable if flawed film, and…",

Probably several things went wrong in the production and the script was probably modified several times. Some top actors like Gary Oldman and Anthony Mackie play pretty insignificant roles. The film just feels off and when the final twist arrives you're like \"that's it...?\". The last 10 minutes of the movie is literally spend on the main character leaving the house and taking a taxi. I understand that this is important because the character finally dares to go outside, but you as a viewer will not be interested by then.

We're all use to seeing him in the comedic role so this was refreshing. That being said, he was not totally believable as an angry cop. You always have the sense that he was going to burst out laughing. There were a couple of believable \"angry\" moments but just a couple. I'm not necessarily a \"Saw\" person and enjoyed this iteration. The movie has its usual interesting and unique bloody scenes.

She is found out to have cheated however and whilst she is heartbroken at not having won she is told that her time will come. This opening is in keeping with the first film and is fantastic.But as the film then flashes forward into 1984 it starts to come seriously unstuck.

The set-up is actually very well done, and the none-too-subtle satire of reality TV is on the mark and largely pretty humorous.Henry Rollins is clearly having a ball hamming it up as the program's host, a macho ex-Marine with a penchant for glaring at the camera and grunting survivalist catch-phrases.

I suppose the pathetically weak romantic subplot involving two minor characters was an attempt to add momentum. The other main draw was apparently the dialect coach who helped Fiennes. Great.\nIf you want scenery, go for a drive. If you want to know anything about Sutton Hoo, visit Wikipedia. If you want romance, watch Bridges of Maddison Country (if you must).

      "review": "I can't stand slow paced long dragged out films at all, but this one was an exception, for many reasons.Firstly, the casting and performances; Washington and Leto were perfection in this one. Had anyone else been cast for either role, I would've lost interest really quick. Malek was ok, but I feel someone else cast - DiCaprio, Gosling, or a Theo James, may have upped the ante as well as Washington and Leto did.Writer and director John Lee Hancock isn't exactly a seasoned filmmaker, but his directing was on point and his screenplay - although not entirely original, played out well. It wasn't Hollywood-ish or action packed, but instead, a more toned down timeline procedural format, and that was a refreshing change. Had it been a little faster paced and/or about 15-20 mins shaved off the 127 min runtime, I think the critics may have been a little less harsh. The cinematography and score were great, although the sound was off in a few scenes - mainly Malek's dialogue/low tonal voice.Nevertheless, I enjoyed it better than I expected. It's a one time view, and well deserving of my 8/10.",

Shaka King made an incredible piece of work. It exceeds as a thriller. The whole time I felt like I was on the edge of my seat. The scenes are so intense and it's King's great direction.

Her singing is excellent in the film - she hits every one of Billie Holiday's hauntingly earthy inflections. The problem is the film itself. It is very confusing with characters in and out who are not explained. We don't learn a lot of substance about Billie Holiday's life - at least anything verifiable - except what we already knew from Lady Sings the Blues. Perhaps my expectations were too high, no pun intended, but I expected this film to give audiences a more intimate picture of her life - her as a complex woman, not just a singing caricature with a heroin needle in her arm. Instead, this is another one of those biopics where the lead actor or actress does more character imitation than provide true insights into the actual subject and her life. This is also one of those films where the singing goes on far too long, but when that happens you know it's because the…",

      "review": "The latest from Lee Daniels (Precious/The Butler), a Hulu original, focuses on the trials & tribulations of legendary singer Billie Holiday. Her song 'Strange Fruit' (a song about lynching) becomes the lightning rod for the FBI's interest, seen in the guise of a leading agent, played by Garrett Hedlund, to keep pressure on her (busting her for drug use or not allowing her proper artist credentials so she couldn't perform in certain venues), meanwhile not being the most savvy of bedfellows she would shack up w/men who would invariably take advantage of her (some even setting her up w/the authorities) or causing controversy when she pursued a same sex affair w/actress Tallulah Bankhead, played by Natasha Lyonne. Focusing on one undercover agent's, played by Moonlight's Trevante Rhodes, efforts to trip her up, he eventually sees the investigation for what it is & even ends up falling in love w/her. Played by Andra Day, in a remarkable performance (I believe she did all her own singing),…",

Inbreeding has been going on again, and once again these freaks hunt humans and eat them.So what starts out as a fun reality game soon becomes a fight for survival against deformed cannibal psychos.And this is where the games begin; by God this movie is gory! I don't think I've seen more blood and guts in a film in my life - and some of the violence and carnage is way beyond the Saw movies. This is true gore horror at its finest.

All the characters are clichés with nearly no acting talent, I'm talking HS student level acting here ROTFL. The inbred hillbillies aren't nearly as scary as in the first one...they try to make them kind of comical. The gore was pretty cheesy, like something you might see in a Sci-Fi channel original.

It was well done, if unsatisfying, and plays on the anxiety and dizziness of ambiguity. It rides this anxiety into the credits, which may leave more than a few moviegoers feeling cheated of the tidy package they expected from a brooding crime drama.I went in knowing nothing except the cast, which is my preference, and was content to judge the film on against a blank slate of expectations. Denzel gave a subdued every-man performance with palpable sincerity. As Deacon, he commanded the screen in a quiet, repressed emotionality indicative of a seasoned actor. Malek was a suitable counterpart, mirroring a younger version of the weathered Deacon. The chemistry was ok between them, but the acting did feel flat and tedious at times, matching the doldrums of their stakeout and beat work. In terms of pacing, very…",

I think it's a complete rewrite because of the story line. Explanation: there are huge story lines missing. Example: the explanation of the dead brother of Ruby Rose's character, the story behind Morgan Freeman's character, what Ruby Rose's character did with her brother to make her an enemy to all the crime bosses, what illness her daughter has, and how she met Morgan Freeman's character. The actors seem to have not been interested the entire movie, and I'm sure it may be because the script they signed contracts for was completely different and possibly better than the pandemic rewrite. It just seems like a forced movie. Its like you came into the movie theater in the middle of the movie.

But unlike Mr. Brown's fictional contemporary, the life of an archaeologist is a far cry from Hollywood's take on this humble profession. This film rather adequately depicts the reality of archaeology in the 1930's and 40's, much of which still persists today. The shovel and mattock are more often the tools of choice than the trowel and brush. The tedious and often dull excavation work requires a strong social aspect and comradely on a site sees them through the often miserable work conditions, with inadequate site facilities and unfavourable weather conditions that persist in this part of the world. It is thus no surprise that much of the movie shows these mundane but essential relationships, the human aspect of being an archaeologist.

      "review": "The year is 2036. America is trying to keep the peace in Eastern Europe especially Ukraine. In addition to aerial drones, the military is also using robotic soldiers called Gumps. Drone pilot Harp (Damson Idris) disobeys order and fires a missile close to the troupes killing two American soldiers. For his reprimand, he is reassigned to follow Captain Leo (Anthony Mackie) on an out-of-the-box ground mission to track down pro-Russian terrorist leader Victor Koval who aims to start a nuclear war.Ukraine doesn't have nukes. Even with the most outrageous conspiracy theory, nobody ever accuses Ukraine of having nukes. It doesn't make political sense. Russia wouldn't let them. The west would disown them. They had to decommission all their nukes before being allowed into the European economic system. I lay this down as my first point because it's indicative of the entire movie. This is trying to be a near future reality. It wants to be realistic. It's not. That gets annoying after awhile.…",

There's no reference to this being a wider problem, it is very much centred entirely around one 'bad apple' in one high school, and in doing so dismisses any idea that this might be global, systemic issue. Throughout the film we see constant sexual harassment, toxic masculinity, gaslighting and gross failures from teaching staff in their duty of care that's tantamount to abuse.

It's just playing on blatant nostalgia with so many nods to the original that It's practically a remake, and a very bad one at that.

      "review": "IN BRIEF: Great performances and sensitive direction create a haunting journey into dementia.JIM'S REVIEW: (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) It's been a few days since I have seen Florian Zeller's brilliant film, The Father, and it still haunts me with its vivid depiction of the ravages of dementia. Other films have previously tackled this tragic disease very well. Amour, Still Alice, Away From Her, Iris, these exceptional films do come to mind, but no moviegoing experience will prepare you for this emotional free-fall.We witness Anthony's mental decline directly as we are transported to his ever-changing world. It is a jarring and disturbing view. Scenes are flipped and repeated by different characters. Actors trade roles and utter familiar dialog heard before. Items are lost or found and settings are slightly askew with changes in decor hinting at his mental disarray and anguish. As moviegoers, we cannot recognize the real from the surreal and the film accomplishes what no other film has done…",

Sure, she never had plans for world domination and she never even tried to murder another human, but she did the one thing that film audiences can never forgive: she tried to kill puppies. It's for this reason that I've been so skeptical about this film, an origin story that attempts to humanize this character by shedding new light on her turbulent past. The cast sounded stacked and Craig Gillespie is a director I've admired ever since \"Lars and the Real Girl,\" but was it possible to tell a sympathetic, Disney-fied story about someone we know will wind up a would-be dog killer?Well, the answer is yes and no, but mostly yes. Before I praise this film for being such an unexpected gem, let me get the couple of problems I have with it out of the way. First and foremost, without giving any spoilers, I never get the true sense that Cruella is…",

How about the fact that Nic Cage doesn't have a single line of dialogue in the entire film, at most only uttering yells of exertion? Or that we are given no information whatsoever about his character except for the dog tags we see hanging from his rearview mirror?

I'm not gonna pretend like I'm the most knowledgable,\nbut I am going to give my POV on what I think this movie is trying to say.I'll start with Deacon (Denzel Washington) who has a reputation in Los Angeles, recognized\nnoticably by Baxter (Rami Malek) who is a rookie detective. So the two of them begin\ncollaberating on a case involving murdered female victims by a sadistic man.In a bar, Baxter raises the question, and I'm paraphrasing, \"Why do cops obsess on a case\nthey are working on well beyond 5+ years while everyone else has moved on??\" Deacon\ncould've continued on the case longer, but the crimes stopped when the culprit moved\nto another town. Outside his jurisdiction and into someone else's.One understanding is that you should never obsess over a case. Move on. The other side\nof that is that if you obsess and play the sick games of the culprit, you might wind up\nmaking a fatal mistake. Deacon accidentally kills a missing victim who startled him in the\nwoods, and Baxter kills Sparma (Jared Leto) who was annoying the heck out of him.\nThat is why it would be much easier to move on. I'm explain why that is in the confines\nof this story in a bit.But yeah, move on and don't stoop to the level of a criminal to solve a crime. When dealing with\na sick man like Sparma, you move on or risk letting him get to you with his minds games, and you\nmake a fatal mistake.It's a tough pill to swallow.Moving on would've been easier in this story for one main reason. Sparma is a crime enthusiast. He meets Baxter and says he is a fan of his work. Basically, Sparma is the type of guy who would watch Law & Order, and take notes. The culprit in each episode is caught because of the details he or she missed that the police detectives catch on to. As Deacon puts it, \"The Little Things\".It's because of that reason that Sparma who basically mastered the act of covering up his tracks, so much so that connecting evidence to him is 100% impossible that he gets away with his crimes; and I do think\nthat Sparma is 100% the culprit for that reason.Evidence is conclusive. Sparma owning a CB radio means nothing. At one point, Baxter has forced Sparma\nto take him to the body of a missing person's case. DOA. Supposedly buried out in the middle of nowhere.\nBaxter has allowed himself to be sucked into Sparma's mind games. Which is why Baxter kills him with the shovel.Sparma is calm the whole time because since he is really good at paying attention to the Little Details in his crimes, he has no need for killing Baxter, and he knows Baxter is not going to find anything anyways, and tomorrow he's gonna go back to work. He even says that, as I paraphrase, \"Can we get this over with. I got work tomorrow.\"Deacon who followed Sparma and Baxter to \"the scene of the crime\" sees what Baxter did and helps him cover it up while desposing of the evidence. Because of their built relationship, Deacon sees that Baxter will become like him in the future if he continues to obsess. Deacon knows that Baxter will be haunted by the innocent victims he let down. Just like Deacon in his own weird way.If I'm right, I don't think it was all for nothing, and I'm sure it'll show in the future anyways if the killings stop. I do think Sparma was the culprit, there was just no evidence tying him to the crimes.In the end, it is safe to assume that Baxter does move on. Again, this is just my baseline understanding. I do think some threads are thrown away, or not touched on much. Like the young girl in the prologue who reappears again much later and is just gone again soon after.If you pick up on those details if I'm on to something, you might be fascinated by this movie quitel like\nI was.",

And you as the audience wonder if they end up having sex or not. That's the plot.\nOk that was really a very shallow view on this film as there is indeed more it tells but its nothing really new. We had that intimate look at a couple's relationship a lot of times before and there is not much to add. Sometimes the film feels like an extended version of the fight scene between Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in \"Eyes Wide Shut\". We learn a lot about the two characters lives, their past and they emotions. There are a few heartbreaking moments that really make it worthwhile. The acting is great, too which is the biggest bonus the film has. Without John David Washington and Zendaya there wouldn't be much left except for an excellent cinematography. But the screenplay is not really that thrilling. It just plays around with various topics of fights, a couple that questions their relationship, their motives. And all of that. Again, had that a dozens time before. The acting and style is what makes it special. The direction by Sam Levinson is also not too shabby. John David Washington is great and shows another range of his immense talent. This is also the film that hopefully gives Zendaya the respect as an actress she deserves. Both are fantastic, both have showed scenes. Both play off each other, its hard to say who is better, but in the essence we see a great showcase of two actors who will have a long and exciting career in Hollywood, who are about to become the leading actors of a new generation.\nAll in all not a bad film but nothing too thought provoking.",

A good actor should be good in anything regardless of the director but he just can't hold on to his own.Sam's Assassination of the Nation was over the top but fun timepass which lead to Euphoria but here he went 2 steps back instead of forward.

However, it fictionalized the story adding a homosexual relationship that never occurred in real life and an affair involving the wife of the closeted husband. I feel this was a tacked on ploy that was not true, and was done because that's what Hollywood does. If it was real and Germaine to the real story I would have felt it relevant, but the fact it was made up entirely is a disservice to the people that actually existed. Otherwise good acting, directing, competently made. It's not the best movie ever but intelligent and interesting enough to sacrifice 2 hours.",

In a film, you are supposed to sympathize with characters and go through their journey and change, but here I found myself hating both characters. They simply didn't seem like good people so I didn't care for them. They argue over and over about the same thing, they swear too much to attempt to add intensity and the story doesn't really take different turns.

I do agree, it is \"Not Bad\" even though I suspect margarida-44311 is a shill with only 4 reviews under her belt - The shark effects are actually, quite surprisingly, pretty passable for a low budget shark movie; with the exception of a bit of dodgy CGI when it attacks the plane it is pulled off quite adequately !Acting is decent for the main part and the photography, beach shots and locations are quite lush and some nice drone shots, and some nasty gore shots of half eaten bodies all add a professional touch.Unfortunately the story is a bit lacking and the same old cliches and a similar ending stolen from The Shallows make it wholly very unoriginal and to be honest, unlike great shark films like The Reef or Open Water, what it majorly lacks is any tension or that palpable sense of fear and dread that those other superb films brought to the table and that is what mainly sinks this one for me!I…",

On the first one, there was an element of surprise, I did not know what to expect, here we just got shots of flesh and not much else, oh sorry and a few scenes with John Rambo. If you like the Zombie and Gore genre, especially good examples such as both the original and the remake of Dawn of the Dead, Hills have Eyes, the Evil Dead series, do yourself a favour don't watch this and be put off this genre for life !!!

He's fully aware of the roles he's taking nowadays and he clearly has a blast making this one too, without saying a single word. His presence really helps this movie too, as he knew exactly what tone to go for.\nAs of right now this is probably the closest we're going to get to a Five Nights At Freddie's movie, and it's a fun enough time to pass 90 minutes.

As a filmmaker, I've worked with limited resources and sometimes the script has to be so simple that the audience cannot tell we worked with what we could under the circumstances. Glad to give Hollywood a glance at the little guys for a change.It was a well casted duo who carried a character driven script in one location, much like a two person play. The monologues were brilliant and endless. Zendaya steals the show early, but JDW catches up in the second half. With a dash of brief comedy, this toxic relationship takes these two to some dark areas and doesn't hold back. An excellent product made under strict circumstances.",

So let's start on a positive note with the magnificent film debut of singer Andra Day. It is phenomenal. Her bold and memorable turn as this talented vocalist conveys her tortured soul and her ability to self-destruct with agonizing details of physical abuse and graphic close-ups of injections. Booze and heroin are her downfall, and so is the willful mission by J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI to destroy this musical icon. It is indeed a story worth telling, but it is the telling of the story that becomes the film's downfall.Targeted by the government for promoting dissent with her signature song, Strange Fruit, a song that decries lynching, FBI agent Harry J.

Even always funny parts in time travel movies when character went through same day hundreds of time and knows random thing that will fall, crush, fly, say etc in this movie looked artificial and forced.

Like this, the movie looks like childish cinema one project created on some film college. For example, very important character - the commando guy looks more like some comedian so at the beginning I was not sure if this is some Steve Martin movie or a horror. Besides, pretty bad acting of some characters is irritating. Once again, instead of intelligent action, director tends to use bizarre scenes to draw our attention. By that he also uncovers many mystic moments that he could use to create tension and fear more effectively then by using kilotons of blood with and without purpose. From my point of view, this is the worse part of the movie trilogy Wrong Turn.",

I challenge you to look up a clip of Fred Hampton, watch the film, and then spot out a moment where Kaluuya's demeanor, mannerisms and voice weren't akin to Hamptons. Lakeith Stanfield is also really great. While I understand Daniel Kaluuya's Fred Hampton is the central character of the film, Stansfield's performance and character William O'Neal, helps drive the movie. He convincingly plays a man who's drowned in the cynicism of being black during the 1960's. In addition to the performances, the entire film is crafted extremely well from the costume design and music to the cinematography. Especially as the film concludes, there are scenes directed and shot so well, they will stick with viewers long after watching.I really had to force myself to think of something negative here.

It was so easy to tell that Chris Rock's rookie partner was behind everything, it was almost laughable. Soon as he showed up on screen and begin talking I could tell it was him. I kept hoping to be thrown off but in the end that wasn't the case. With Saw X just being announced, the studio needs to go with new writers or bring back the old ones. The way this one ends, where the hell do you go now? Chris Rock's character knows who this guy is. I felt they kind of botched the ending. The strings holding Sam Jackson should have ripped him apart as SWAT was entering the room and then they should have shot Chris Rock while he ran in from the side. The rookie shuts the door to the elevator and laughs \"Game over\". The rest of the movie was fine. The traps weren't that interesting and it's different not having the presence of you know who and his puppet.",

The main protagonist, played by an excellent Owen Wilson, made the wrong decisions. He lost his wife, his family, his job and is now homeless and a drug addict.This movie is a work of art.

      "rating": 4,
      "review": "The costumes and overall historical production design looks good, and Andra Day is great playing Billie Holiday, but otherwise \"The United States vs. Billie Holiday\" is a meandering, poorly-constructed biopic. That despite the reflexive framing of the story as a recorded interview that should've focused the narrative besides reflecting the audial sensation of Holiday's singing.Instead, we get a plot that often doesn't seem to be going anywhere besides from scene to scene of shooting up heroin, from concert to concert and abuse or sex scenes from man to man, with a hint of bisexuality. A wallowing, hot-mess portrait of Lady Day. All the while, cut occasionally to narcs planting evidence or saying something racist and inevitably being told off to presumed audience cheering. Even if the remembered scenes of Holiday's past as the black FBI agent follows her from a lynching through her upbringing in a brothel is almost effective, the montage covering again the aforementioned sort of scenes we've already seen several times in slight variations, plus some fight between two guys, certainly isn't. And to top it off there's that atonal, fourth-wall-breaking mid-credits scene after the requisite biopic text at the end to give us the Wikipedia headlines of what happened to the characters after the movie.Yet, Day is great, an actual singer who sings the part and in the imitated style of the character she's performing. Her reported weight loss and picking up of smoking and drinking for the part is some impressive dedication, too, even if she wisely didn't go to Nick Nolte levels of method acting in using heroin as he did for \"The Good Thief\" (2002). Day deserved better direction, the social commentary on civil rights deserved more than simplistic tropes, \"Strange Fruit\" better than \"Tigress and Tweed,\" and Holiday a more focused biographical picture.I'll have to check out \"Lady Sings the Blues\" (1972), which stars Diana Ross and also received awards attention, someday for comparison.",

      "review": "A successful horror movie should be enthralling enough to suspend any rational reasoning, because, let's face it, logic is seldom found in the genre. Sure sure, there's usually a plausible mystery setting the table, but soon enough the dining tablecloth is pulled out and all hell breaks loose.This is the sink or swim portion of the experience, where audiences are either reeled in or lost to whatever's on Netflix. And though \"In The Earth\" has a lot of loose end, batshit explaining to do, it provides just the right amount of vibrant thrills for a passing grade.There are curveballs a plenty here to swing at, which makes the developing, tangly plotline tough to decipher, but who cares, there's a slinky temptation about the proceedings that just works. What appears to be a pandemic epic, quickly turns into a scientific camping trip that is equal parts Dr. Moreau and Blair Witch. Spoiler: not fun.Science mixes with mythology, wacky experiments are run, relationships are strained, tenting goes awry. Mother Earth, as welcoming friend, vengeful foe or perhaps just a vibrant backdrop, dominates the screen in a rich tapestry of greens and reds, unforgiving terrain, and impenetrable fog. A feast for the eyes, especially the throbbing, pulsing, sporing mushrooms. She breathes!As horror 101 would dictate, we have the bewildered innocents hunted by the psychotic elements. There's another worldly \"Deliverance\" desperation feel here, as our reluctant couple scramble for survival in an ecosystem they can't seem to escape, captured and tormented by a lunatic fringe on a crazy Pagan ritual bender.Joel Fry is especially well cast as the gangly, stumbling, helpless Martin, who spends a good chunk of the adventure trying to avoid various foot problems. Not for the squeamish, these podiatry sequences escalate to comical proportions. That is the sign of horror success: when a guffaw is elicited during what is otherwise considered a most unfortunate circumstance.Filmed economically, with scalpel precision by Ben Wheatley, \"In The Earth\" proves the power behind the less is more aesthetic, especially when clever camera work is employed.The end may be a bit lacking and open ended for those who prefer proper, paint by numbers closure, but hell, the throbbing ride alone is worth the ticket. Recommended unless over stimulation, aurally and visually, proves too disturbing. But then again, this is not the genre for the weak. Buck up!hipCRANK.",

Some offered me a blast of pure entertainment, others left me crying like a baby, and dozens made me laugh uncontrollably. Nevertheless, the most memorable movies are the ones that profoundly impact me emotionally either by remembering me of a past phase of my life or by possessing main characters who I can strongly relate to. What might be \"just another film\" for most viewers can ultimately become a personal journey for other people in the audience, which is how I partially experienced The Father. I didn't have massive expectations for the movie itself, but I was curious to know how great Anthony Hopkins would be.While the legendary actor is undoubtedly a notable standout, Florian Zeller's creative, unconventional storytelling left me completely floored. By the end of the film, I felt emotionally drained of all my feelings and thoughts due to the increasingly…",

Edgar Hoover and the FBI illegally investigated any Black subversive protest groups during the 60's, with the Black Panther Party as their No. 1 target. Recent films seem obsesses with that matter (One Night in Miami, MLK/FBI, The Trial of the Chicago Seven, the soon-to-be -released The United States vs, Billie Holiday). You can now add to the fold, Shaka King's searing indictment, Judas and the Messiah.This bio-pic tells the true story of Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya), chairman of the BPP, who is ultimately betrayed by an FBI informant, William O'Neal (Lakeith Stanfield). The film chronicles Mr. Hampton's life and death with a searing performance by Mr. Kaiuuya as the doomed crusader. There is no doubt that this performance will be recognized this award season.

The probability at the time based on the events happening in the United States with race relations and Edgard Hover (then FBI director) doing everything in his power to orchestrate the deaths of black activist, naturally gave rise to a Messiah \"Hampton\" and a Judas \"O'Neal\" who would betray him.Both Daniel Kaluuya (playing Hampton) and Lakeith Stanfield (playing O'Neal) do a fantastic work embodying their characters and re-enacting them to life. Very much like the carpenter from 2000 years ago 1/3 the world still worships, Fred Hampton was indeed a Messiah that pointed out the hypocrisy in the American system and preached sermons that empowered and brought unlikely factions of people…",

      "review": "This Korean production clearly rivals Hollywood ones. Many point at Firefly as inspiration, but I would say Valerian is also a good comparison. The story is original and has an interesting premise. The CGI and set design are top notch, no question about that. The multi-lingual thing isn't too distracting to me, as I am watching it with subtitles anyway, but that actually resolves \"why everyone speaks English in movies\".The deal-breakers for me are, however, the screenwriting and editing:\nMany scenes are unnecessarily long.Instead of \"show, don't tell\", they foreshadow it, then show it, then also exposit it. Say, a certain underground fight sequence. It is foreshadowed by a friend's visit, then with the knife, then the person is shown, then said person explains everything... That's too much, don't you think?The transition between set pieces is not smooth. Consciously you know they are heading to the next location to progress the plot, but the cuts are jarring.The timing of events are also quite bad. Say, in a rescue mission, the protagonist has the time to leave the ship to do a side quest, while the crew is supposed to be leaving immediately, and he manages to catch up. The finale is a time-critical mission, but there are at least two extra set pieces inserted. Then when they have just broadcasted a message out, everyone is already there somehow.The hero's realization happens too late, and too sudden. But you know it's going to happen since early in the movie, so the protagonist is being an unnecessary a**h*le throughout most of the movie.Too many plot twists. Some really obvious, some really bad. The final one was brilliant and heart-wrenching, then they have to ruin that with another plot twist and a plot hole as a byproduct.Too many plot holes. I feel like the writers have some plot milestones to hit, but just lazily filled in the sequences in between.Background characters, like people watching the news, are given close ups. But their acting are so bad/stiff...All in all, I like the concept, and I am surprised by the quality. But there are jarring holes in the execution that I just couldn't ignore. For storytelling purpose, I would say a trilogy or a miniseries are more appropriate formats for this IP.",

      "review": "It is one of those films that are soothing for me to watch. Knowing characters like Edith existed (and continue to exist) turns on a light. She tells excavator Basil Brown that she \"feels\" something lays beneath the mounds on her property. Of course she is an experienced archeologist and of course, as Daniel Kahneman says, she has the \"expert intuition\" but she says she feels, nonetheless. She pursued this undertaking not only because as an archeologist she could recognize the patterns but also because she was compelled by her inner forces to try and create something very much worth experiencing and not just for herself. As the story progresses she finds out she is terminally ill. She draws strength from each to face the other and manages to make such harmonious realizations of both endeavors. It reminded me of a scene in which Harry (in Harry Potter stories), abandoning all apparent logic, goes to see Hagrid in his shed. I don't recall in what context this happens but I do remember…",

The set design is excellent, and along with cold emotionless expressions on the actors and shots of the mundane lives of the would-be colonists, helps to establish a plausible set-up with tons of potential. They know they're the first generation of a ship on a multi-generational voyage to colonize another planet, and may also be humanity's last hope of survival. Their grim personas express their awareness of this fact and that the mission is paramount. There's even a mysterious hint at an unexpected presence on the ship to add to the suspense.Don't bother watching the second half though. As a lot of other reviews have mentioned, it tries to adapt a plot similar to Lord of the Flies, however the big difference here is that these teenagers are supposed to have been highly trained for this mission their entire lives, and are literally the future of humanity. They're not a ragtag group of students on a deserted island…",

      "review": "A beautiful film to watch and perhaps the ultimate \"cup of tea film\".Incredibly English. I really loved the relaxing meditative pace of it, which reminded me of an old-school version of TV show Detectorists.Ralph Fiennes was loveable and effective in his transformation into Basil Brown. Carey Mulligan also delivered an effective, yet understated performance in her roles as Edith. Lily James and Johnny Flynn added an extra layer to proceedings.The most impactful element here was that the film itself began to resemble \"a snapshot\" into the lives of others in a different time and place. The film itself felt like an archaeological dig into the past, with little character studies here and there, lives and loves, just like the dig of the Anglo-Saxon treasure examined history.Recommend for those wanting a perfectly British movie to go with their cup of tea.",

I've yet to see Vanessa Kirby in Pieces of a Woman but intend to watch her movie today.\nI must say up until today my favourite nominated performance by an Actress in a film is Carey Mulligan but today I've changed my mind because Andra Davis is mesmerising as Billie Holiday.\nAlmost 50 years after Diana Ross earned an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Billie Holiday in 1972's \"Lady Sings the Blues\" this new film that centres around the origin of the song that Billie Holiday sang titled \"Strange Fruit.\" which is now included in the Top 100 American songs list.\nHarry Anslinger a known racist ,played in the movie so well by Garrett Hedland…",

It should have been called \"We couldn't find Jason Bourne, but made a Bourne movie anyways\".Please don't butcher Debt of Honor or Red Storm Rising.

Is it the total disregard for the most basic facts about technology (like the \"bypass the firewall\" routine on a effing spaceship, or the single point of failure of having a single \"systems room\" in the spaceship that is supposed to be the last hope of humankind)? Is it the total disregard for physics (the final plot-twisting scene involving an airlock goes against almost everything we know about physics and human homeostasis, but what the hell...)?

      "review": "A story about an archaeological dig may seem to be a subject of narrow interest to many for a full-length drama. However, director Simon Stone weaves a story of depth with many layers uncovered along the way. Carey Mulligan is outstanding as Edith Pretty, a widow with a bad heart but with a sense of discovery on her British estate. She employs Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) to lead a team excavating the mounds of land to find what treasures lie beneath.\nBeautiful cinematography adds to this gem as England is on the cusp of war in 1938. Lily James is charming as a woman in a loveless marriage whose future plans are stymied due to the impending conflict with Germany.\nBases on a true story, The Dig explores the meaning of history and life through past civilizations but also raises the question of what happens to us, if anything, once our time is up on earth. This is a movie that will keeping you thinking long after the credits roll.",

Dementia and Alzheimer's disease are frequent topics in movies these days for the simple reason that so many are impacted either directly or through a friend or family member. The importance of memory to our core being cannot be over-stated. It's crucial to who we are and what we feel. The first feature film from French director Florian Zeller is an excellent and poignant tale, all too real for those who have experienced this with a loved one. Zeller adapted his own play (winning a Tony Award for Frank Langella) with his co-writer, Oscar winner Christopher Hampton (DANGEROUS LIASONS, 1988). It's also one of the few films where Set Design is so crucial that it basically serves as a main character.Whereas most of these movies provide the perspective of the caregiver or family members, this one is extraordinary in also giving us the point-of-view of the one suffering.

      "review": "Absolutely stellar performances in this film, especially from Kaluuya and Stanfield. Honestly, with the two of them I feel like we're getting glimpses at the future acting stars in Hollywood because I've yet to see either of them in something where they're not delivering. Those two aside, the rest of the cast here is solid as well with no real low notes to speak of. This is an acting film, 100% driven by performances and yet that leads into the reason I don't love it as much as a lot of people seem to. These characters are all so fascinating and I feel like, in an effort to capture the movement going on, the film fails to live with these characters enough. When the credits rolled I felt unsatisfied with the amount of time spent with them and not in a \"Oh my god I could watch another three movies with these guys\" kind of way. So much is happening here that I never felt I got enough time to really focus on the journey some of these people are taking. Stanfield specifically feels like he's on a Donnie Brasco-esque journey of self discovery but rather than moving along in a natural, steady pace it seems like his character jumps from stage to stage in his progression and I so wanted to see more of the turmoil and struggle he was going through.Thinking on that now, I wonder if this would've been better off as a limited miniseries just because there is so much to cover and trying to push it all into one movie doesn't give enough time for all of it. Even a 5 hour long miniseries would've given enough time to really capture all the complexities, the dilemmas facing these characters and I think would've been devastatingly powerful.As it stands, Judas and the Black Messiah feels like a phenomenal display of acting talent but a bit of a misstep in terms of story and plotting and that latter hangup really prevents the strengths of this movie from being as powerful as I feel they could have been. I know I'm in the minority here, I know people are loving this movie and they absolutely should. It's solid and has an very prescient message. I just can't help but wonder about the greatness that could have been. Still recommend everyone watch this. It's worth it. I just didn't find myself swept up into the hype machine.",

This should get the Understatement of the Year award. Cliched script, plodding direction, bad acting: Katheryn Winnick, in a pointless bit part, was the only female presence of any note and most of her acting was done by her low-cut tops (which every self-respecting State police woman wears as standard issue). Mr. Neeson's character looked genuinely tired and frustrated with his life, but this did not require any acting on his part, the script took care of it. Everybody else looked like they were doing a chore. Dialogue was awful and seemed like teased with pliers. Action was sparse and not entertaining, and the chemistry between the lone old man and the boy non-existent. And then, there were the plot holes...

      "review": "As a sexagenarian, I am not the target audience for this film but I like anything that is good. I was thumbing through my Roku looking for a movie to play while I gamed and read a book. The reason I stopped to play this film was because I had seen Kathryn Newton the previous day in \"Freaky.\" She is very good here as she was in that film.Another reviewer said that they were \"drawn into the film\" and so was I. My gaming stopped as did the book reading and my attention became focused on MTPT. I found it charming and Ms. Newton was very good as was Jermaine Harris, but felt that Mr. Allen failed to deliver on some one word lines that would have improved the quality of his performance and the film. The director should have caught these and worked with him on the line deliveries and the fact that he did not may represent a shortfall in Ian Samuels' ability, at least this point in his career.Overall, a very nice and charming little film, which is the type I love to find. A lot of reviewers are rating this a nine, but I'm a hard marker and will give it a seven, which is pretty good since I gave Hitchcock's \"Foreign Correspondent\" a six.Well worth your time and attention.",

I didn't think it an be that bad with an actor like Morgan Freeman in it and a decent budget, but it is!I was never a Morgan Freeman fan, for some reason his voice and acting style didn't resonate well with me at all, however this has nothing to do with Mr. Freeman. The main problem with this movie is the horrible editing, sound mixing and acting of all other actors. After you get passed that you can also see that the story is also weak and unbelievable, but again, it is a distant second to the atrocious movie making skills of whoever was involved in this dreck.Starting with a non-ending horribly edited beginning credits you are already starting questioning what you are going to see, and it is not getting any better. The general story is about an underground crime network that has corrupt cops supporting it (nothing new really). I lasted about 30…",

After being detained and imprisoned without charges in Guantánamo Bay Priso by the U.S. government for years, their case and cover-up finally goes to trial with some surprising turns of events.The Mauritanian is based on a true story and director Kevin McDonald skillfully depicts a series of chain events that led to Slahi's capture and imprisonment. The screenplay by M.B. Traven, Rory Haines, and Sohrab Noshirvani has some compelling dialog and strong conformational set pieces, but it is a tad choppy with out-of-sequence flashbacks providing his backstory. These scenes tend to slow down the film's pacing and serve more as sub-plot…",

It was a very entertaining and fast-paced (granted it was only 81 minutes long) thrill-ride that rarely let up until the credits rolled. I wanted to see a sequel all along, but a Direct-to-DVD one wasn't what I had in mind. So, yeah, when I heard about this being a Direct-to-DVD sequel with a plot about reality show contestants no less, I was expecting it to be entertaining crap at best. But once the movie was wrapped and people were able to see screenings of it, surprisingly positive things were actually being said about it. Some were even saying it was better than the original. How could that be? Were these people that just didn't like the original and found it easy to surpass? I didn't see how a Direct-to-DVD sequel with a plot I wasn't very thrilled about could manage the feat of being better than the first.

If she is to survive she will have to recover enough of her memories to learn about the situation she is in... and avoid some of MILO's attempts to make her little remaining time more comfortable.Going into this film I'd say the less you know the better; there are some good twists and it is best one learns facts at the same time as our protagonist. The film is, apart from a few brief flashbacks, set almost entirely within the cramped pod; this gives an impressively claustrophobic feel to proceedings.

The script isn't going to win an Oscar but the premise of the story is good.A young priest is sent to work with an exorcist (Pearce) who has some alternative ways of working. You get a bit of his backstory as to why he does what he does, and he has to mentor the somewhat nervy Fr Daniel, thrown into the world of aggressive exorcisms.There are a few good moments in the movie, and without spoiling it, the ending you could see coming about 2/3rds of the way through, but it still entertained me.I think with a bit of polish on the script, this could have been a lot better, but I give it an 8 as I enjoyed it, and in today's bland movie scene thanks to Covid, this did take me away from everything for 90 minutes.",

I can understand why some are disappointed. No outrageous cgi and effects were limited but I am tired of movies being carried on effects mostly with a platoon strong group of main characters.As said I enjoyed it. Kids did enjoy that too. The little one was shortly off at the end but I guess that was too much for 10yo.I gave it 7 for good acting and good story.

Highlights: Henry Rollins gets the role fans have been ready for him to play forever as Dale Murphy, a Rambo for the new generation. The body count is terrific (one of the flaws of the original was the low body count) as blood, guts, and other unmentionable objects fly across the screen in a litany of grue and terror that should make any horror fan weep.

      "review": "Imagination.. Heart..Very few sci-fi's have this much heart and this much story packed into a beautiful movie.. So how can I describe Cherry?Cherry starts out like every good story and builds up to it, by first establishing the universe.. a post-apocalyptic world (or sum such) where recycling is important, new fashions are in play and sex robots are possible and people (at least from the characters point of view) have to have contracts to date/copulateCherry then shows us one of the first *real* female action hero's (basically Tomb Raiders Laura Croft v1.0) and some great desert and action sequences that are widely unpredictable and done wellAll the while this stories carries on with credibility and imagination, Cherry 2000 is one of the most successful B movie sci-fi's ever accomplished it's these kinds of movies that give me hope to see more.. I personally love and still love a lot of 80's movies and 80's style we have yet to recapture in our let's make it all more real setting.. I'm not saying that gems aren't still made today they are; they've just been rarer to find as of late..Since Cherry is a special vein of movies all its own it's important we list e'm - Mad Max - The Road Warrior (this one is very special) - Dead-End Drive In What I can say about Cherry after multiple viewing maybe 5-7 now in my lifetime since I first caught in cinemax or one of the movie channels one night.. is that's its very, very special.. That the story is so good that it can play catch-up or compliment movies like \"A.I.\" another one of Kubrick's unfigured out masterpieces..Normally I would say this movie is 7/10 but I'm upping my vote to 8/10 for now do to shear appreciation of this movie vs. some of the crap we have been getting these past 2 decades.. (note of course sci-fi had a great few years from about 1997 to 2001)On my last viewing this time I noticed again how good Basil Poledouris score compliments the movie.. (and there is some noticeable re-use of Conan in there but all composers even the great John Williams seem to re-use in part some of their stuff)",

      "review": "Coming to America is one of Eddie Murphy's most charming and funny films. The idea if going back to his character of Akeem and bring back most of the cast for a sequel sounds good right? But when I saw the trailer for this sequel I was not expecting much. Trailers, especially for sequels should make you excited to see them. This one didn't. And after enduring the hour and 45 minutes of this film I can see why the trailer was so bad. There was no good laughs to put in it!!!This is one of the worst sequels ever made. I know that it was released straight to streaming but I feel that Paramount must have had no confidence to release this in theaters. Yes I know that theaters are virtually empty because of COVID but if this were released under normal circumstances I think it would have failed at the box office. I get that sequels are mostly cash grabs these days and are almost always inferior to their originals but the dip in quality of this film compared to the first one is gigantic!!! It…",

I love the reimagined Wizard of Oz allegory, dynamic plot, production quality, talented international cast, and richness of the elaborate multicultural world and full-bodied characters - amalgams of collective dystopian civilizations and all my favorite elements of some of the best sci-fi movies that have crossed our paths through the decades - 'Blade Runner', 'Serenity', 'Guardians of the Galaxy', 'The Fifth Element', 'Total Recall', and many others. A handful of awkward lines as well as scenes with lukewarm tertiary character acting or mildly disjointed transitions do detract a few decimal points from a perfectly seamless viewing experience, but the magnitude and refreshing exhilaration of the entire film still overpower those and make it a must-see.

I don't watch trailers, but I did look into this and it peaked my interest. Jaime decided to see it with me as well when we went to a local theater. The synopsis here is a hearing-impaired girl is visited by the Virgin Mary and can suddenly hear, speak and heal the sick. As people flock to witness her miracles, terrifying events unfold.We start this movie off back in 1845. We are seeing a point of view of a woman being executed for being a witch. The mask of Satan is nailed to her face, she is hung from a tree and set on fire. What I found interesting here is that we never move away from this and it is quite horrific what happens to her. The last thing is that the man in charge holds up a doll that is wrapped in a chain to prevent her from coming back.The movie then takes us to Gerry Fenn (Jeffrey Dean Morgan).…",

His performance is profoundly disturbing.The dialogue is endlessly quotable but what it does as a whole is take the viewer with the Black Panthers into their mission and introduces them to the brotherhood and the community that surrounds the revolution. Many scenes make it easy to humanize and love the Messiah, showing Fred in his everyday life, steadfast and incorruptible.

Yes, it is about finding artifacts in England at the beginning of WWII, but, in reality it is a character study about the folks who's lives were impacted by this marvelous discovery. With crisp writing and superb acting from all involved, we are transplanted into the lives of ordinary people who stumbled into an extraordinary adventure. Some reviewers complained that too many extraneous characters were introduced at varying times, but, that (it appears) is how the actual events may have unfolded. And all of the characters are treated in a way that tries to explore their own demons and proclivities in a manner which never seems to wander into stereotypes. These were, in fact, average citizens and their lives deserved to be presented in an appropriate way. If you are looking for a documentary portrayal of this event, then you may very well be disappointed. While the…",

Despite some people saying it was predictable at points, which I can see that now, I went it to it with no expectations.It started for me as it implied, someone stuck in a chamber, perhaps in a hospital, or maybe kidnapped. Then we learn that this is actually a spaceship destined for a new planet. THEN we continue to find near the end that our character and everyone on board is not even real, but clones of the doomed on Earth.This movie is sometimes terrifying in the hopelessness and anticipation for death, with many attempts at survival falling short, until we get a satisfying ending for the future.I think for the right people, it did what it wanted to do and was surprising, and even if you saw it coming, I think it was still filmed and told exceptionally.",

Needless to say, this British drama about an excavation of the Sutton Hoo burial site right as World War II was beginning certainly delivers. The film focuses on two main characters, Edith (Carey Mulligan) and Basil (Ralph Fiennes.) Edith is a woman living on the property near the Sutton Hoo, reeling from grief yet also thoughtfully determined and autonomous in both her interpersonal and private lives. Basil is a mild-mannered archaeologist helping lead the excavation. Mulligan and Fiennes each portray remarkable emotional cores in their performances, and clearly are also able to convey the general sense of fear and uncertainty at the time in the United Kingdom as World War II was beginning through their performances as well as the broader historical context of the story.The cinematography of rural England…",

      "review": "It was not the worst movie I have ever seen, but the plot was incredibly dumb. The utterly ridiculous premise about super-assassins being sent to kill each other, or just one, while they operate without any clue regarding evidence, DNA or other real world issues. Also, the entire premise of hiring an assassin then making them guess who the target is seems pretty stupid. What assassin would take such a job, and what idiot pays money to maybe have the wrong person(s) killed?The plot holes are enormous.The premise of the movie is that the Virtuoso is a professional assassin who is remorseful for an accidental killing. His Mentor, for whatever reason, decides he needs to be dead, but instead of just killing him when he had ample opportunity, the Mentor devises a complex scheme whereby 4 killers are sent on a mission to kill *someone* for *some reason*. Each other? Just him?In the near-final scene where the Virtuoso meets his killer, they discuss inane issue. The *Deputy* could not be made to look like he was killed by bad guys because he had the real Deputy's body in the trunk of the Sheriff's vehicle. The police would not overlook that when investigating the fake Deputy's death.The guy who had a heart attack induced had several fake ID's in his wallet, leaving only one at random would not fool police into thinking he was just some poor schmuck, it would, they would discover it was fake, he had a gun, etc. Hilarity ensues.The final living killer is just as nonsensical as he is. Apparently, to the writer, getting away with murder is a common and easy experience requiring very little in way of not leaving evidence. She has sex with the Virtuoso, which makes no sense if she knows she will kill him, takes a shower allowing the Virtuoso to find her passport and figure out who she is. She then kills him after their ridiculous *one-professional-killer-to-another* conversation, goes to his house, feeds his dog and and nearly shoots it but changes her mind.The plot makes me wonder which one of the actors read it and thought \"that is possible and could happen in real life, I would like to be a part of this.\"Donnie Darko is not real, but it isn't supposed to be, and is an entertainment masterpiece. The Virtuoso is supposed to be something that could happen in real life, is a trainwreck of unrealistic logic and events, and generally is not very good.Plus the ending sucked. They could have ended it like the Mechanic, where he died but everyone else also gets killed by his revengeful nature.",

      "review": "This film has so many interesting ideas but i found that it doesn't really follow all of them though.I'm pretty confused at the low score and how badly it is being panned by critics.I thought the acting was pretty good and i was really interested in these characters. Which is where i think some of the issue are found.I think this film needed to take a step back from the sci-fi elements. They are very sparse but are there enough to hinder the true storyline. If i am being honest i think the whole 2nd act needed retooling. It was like a brick wall that the movie just slammed into. And then it just sort of slogged along. Once again i thought 'oh this is interesting' but then it just like stalled and i sat around thinking what is this movie now. It kind of gets its momentum back in the 3rd act but i think the 1st is where this movie shines.This movie is also great at visual storytelling. The production design, costuming and make up all work so well. It allows you to understand what the film is trying to say before the film explicitly tells you and i though that was really good.I honestly think this movie could have been great but it just got its self bogged down with the sci-fi part and trying to trick? the audience.I think it held its cards too close to its chest but i think the twist is blatantly clear from literally the first scene. This isn't a bad thing at all. I think it would have been better letting us view this world though the lens of us knowing twist from the beginning. I think that would have been a much more interesting and very eye opening character and subject study.",

You can be 'sorry' but not apologetic. This film displays the variation between the two. One is lined in sensitivity, empathy, the other is a projection of our defense mechanisms & pride. This movie ask challenging questions about self-worth and how do you define something abstract like 'love'? Why would you ever want someone you 'love' to feel like bad? Why argue to be 'right,' so vehemently, that you make the person you 'love' feel weak,dumb, inferior, conflating facts to make a bad point? I suppose we can all be a bit of #MalcolmandMarie Two people going back and forth can be suspenseful as hell! The cinematography, the acting, the authenticity! Dope, emotional movie!

You don't have to read this review because it's just not worth it.First of all, Melissa McCarthy's character (I'm too lazy to call her by her name so we'll call her Melissa) tries to pull of the \"village idiot\" stunt in the most embarassing way, and comes off selfish and almost bully-like to Octavia Spencer's character. She also makes fun of nerds/ \"smart\" people, even to Octavia's daughter which is a really boring and overused trope. At some point she even feels entitled to know about Octavia's life (such as the existence of her daughter) even though Melissa was the one who cut Octavia off.The \"jokes\" in this movie are objectively unfunny, and run off for far too long. One example is a joke near the beginning of the movie between Melissa and some cafe owner who she's friends with, and the cafe guy makes a weird error in his speech and he keeps trying to make joke after joke about it, but it just comes off so awkward.

Being aware that it was set during a few hours of this couples night, that it was an intimate look into their lives, it was truely special. The blocking of each scene is so meticulously mapped out despite it looking so natural. The way there able to frame each character, like one character walking into frame by a mirror and the other leaning by a door frame, purely beautiful composition. And yet upon reading about the film, I see that some of the scenes had improvised blocking with a hand hold camera capturing each moment. In fact the first two days of footage for the opening scene was cut out in favour of a more relaxed improvised version, which spurred Zendaya to turn to John David Washington and say, 'This is how he works\". This film comes from Sam Levinson the creator and main director on the HBO hit 'Euphoria', and you can really see that the man has a way to beautifully…",

Maybe not as good as it could be, but Oxygen is a tense ride from start to finish. If there's one thing going for it, the atmosphere makes for an entertaining watch. So much suspense is built that you'll want to know what's going to happen next. The first act is pretty predictable in terms of what beats it's going to hit.

The writers should've chosen one of the arcs to focus on and really honed in on that; Kiera's storyline would've been great for this.If the majority of Moxie's attention turned towards working on Kiera winning the scholarship, as in, they spent lots of time and energy campaigning only to have her lose to Mitchell who only won due to his reputation, popularity and generally him just showing up, then her loss would've hit much harder.

If those movies don't mean anything to you, or if you have come to known the director by some of his more recent productions like 'High-Rise' and 'Rebecca', this will be a confusing and potentially disappointing ride. While this is not a pandemic-flick Ã  la 'Outbreak' I consider it the truest, even the only, depiction of a pandemic-ridden world I have seen to date. The mundane and low key depictions of pandemic coping rituals are fuelling the core value proposition of the film as a dark horror fantasy about our biological mandate to make sense of it all even where there might be no sense to be made. Thank you for this movie Ben, and glad you're back.",

      "review": "This was a movie that I'll be honest, jumped on to my radar as something to see for this year thanks to Duncan from The Podcast Under the Stairs. Him and Mr. Watson did a season of Opera Omnia that covered the filmography of writer/director Ben Wheatley. He's a director that I believe I've only seen one of his films at this time, but that one I really liked. For this, I came in blind just knowing it was getting some buzz, that it was horror and getting to see it in the theater. The synopsis is as the world searches for a cure to a disastrous virus, a scientist and park scout venture deep in the forest for a routine equipment run.We start this movie off with someone with a sledgehammer breaking a rock. They are smashing it into tiny pieces and the reason for this, they are creating a booby-trap. One of these placed in the ground and hidden with grass over it. We then shift over to Martin Lowery (Joel Fry) approaching a cabin. As the synopsis states, there is a virus pandemic so they…",

I liked the first one, so I continued to watch the second movie. I definitely thought that the second film would be trash compared to the first, as it is kind of how sequels in horror films generally are. Boy, was I wrong! 'Wrong Turn 2: Dead End' has gratuitous amount of blood and entertainment. It is fun and gory and definitely a sequel which is better than its predecessor. Also, you don't even have to know anything about the first film to get it. Now, that is a bonus which many sequels don't have.A group is about to film a survival TV series in the middle of the woods of West Virginia. The show is called 'Apocalypse' where they have to think that the world as they knew it has ended and they are the only survivors and whoever wins will take home 100,000$.

Therefore they could have had more money bought a few things had them delivered, maybe ordered a Christmas hamper and ate the delivery dude. Now let me think. Hum! they could not have been too far into the backwoods as there where plenty of cars and these idiots on the survivor show where there. So why no man-hunts for all these missing people? And why is it assumed that these monsters would act this way? And although it would be difficult due to deformities for some of these people to speak (apart from a clear Amen) You would think the parents of the original kids would teach them simple language skills.

To me, it falls short on both.The main issue I have with this movie is the casting of Zendaya as the lead actress. Her acting is similar to Brie Larson's. They both are very \"dry\" and boring when delivering lines and both make scenes dull. Zendaya ruined the first Spider-Man film she was in for me with her acting. She is being overly sexualized in this film. She will be forever be looked at as a child to most due to her childish looks. This role should have been played by someone else.The dialog in this movie has powerful messages about Hollywood, but the overdone and uneccesary cursing deducts from it. They also say each other's names entirely too much.I wanted to like this movie, but it was not good at all. It's like the worst of Tyler Perry's and Spike Lee's movie styles had a baby together.",

The first WW movie was not that great, but Patty did not write that one, this sequel she did and it is worthless. I was wondering if I was watching a drama or a action hero franchise. First the movie is far to long, the dialogue's are pointless and boring, you can skip with ease them because the story is not that complicated. For the action, the effects are good, not worth the time to watch, but still well made, but there are not very much action scenes. If you look at the demographic of the votes you can see girls <18 years are the only ones who love this movie, and that should have been the warning that should have been given with this movie: only see this movie if you are a teenage girl.",

Everything else makes me just wonder \"why\"? Logic behind Lizs' action is dubious. Technology makes my eyes roll. Holograms, yet still can't do anything better than 1st iteration of faulty google AI, that can't even answer basic questions \"cause reasons\"? Hundreds of buttons, screens, panels... But they are useless? A capsule that requires a code to open... FROM INSIDE?! Whole 'room' flashes angrily red while it malfunctions? That sure as hell will be usefull for confused occupant of said capsule, yeah, lets just make him even more confused while he can't see panels nor anything. Smart. A static noise while calling via net? Really? A policefolks still operating like it's early 1900s? No.. actually, that's correct.Main character, Liz, a scientist, acts like headless, highly emotional, chicken with extreme glimpses of inspiration, suddenly asking extremaly relevant questions... just to act like a goof right after untill next flash of wisdom. Terrible, totally pointless and annoying flashbacks. Listen, movie, what's the point of quick flashbacks here? Other than disrupt the flow of the movie?Overall: she doesn't act like human being. The script makes her too artificial. I do, however, like (sarcasm) how she undermines her own survival by going into hysteria. Yep, nothing fixes your issues as good as turning your brain off to scream while your *insert movies name here* deplates. Smart.If you guys like detective puzzles and try to actively work on solving the mystery, or even try to compete with actor with 'who gets the correct answer first', this movie will be nothing more than mudcake to eat through. It makes issues for the sake of adding some drama.If you don't mind all of that... then the movie gets a whole lot better, so.. Yea, brain off, movie good, or brain on, movie bad.",

That's the same director of Smoking Aces, and you can see a lot of his dynamics playing out perfectly on this movie.\nThe big surprise comes with the main character's arch. The story is good enough, but the journey the protagonist has to go through in order to see the next day is a game changer, satisfying, it pays off.\nThe movie is not perfect and that's all right. We can't expect a film to meet everyone's expectations. Those guys did their best and at the end of the day, they achieved it.\nI'm one of those people who doesn't get impressed easily, I hate CGI and think that most movie makers these days don't have the balls to make characters…",

Her only companion to whom she could talk to is an A. I. called MILO. MILO informed her that the oxygen reserves in her pod are only at 35% and she may die of asphyxiation she doesn't do anything about it. From here she decided to do some investigations on her own to find out everything she needs to know about who she was, where she is, why she's trapped in the cryochamber and how she can survive by using MILO to aid in her investigation. I enjoyed the second half of the movie when the first major plot twist was revealed (there are two) I especially liked her conversation with the female doctor who revealed to her where she is and what happened (first plot twist) and her finding out who the doctor was (second plot twist).8/10.",

When it does ease up you have some quirky comedy met with some touching father & son moments. Very interesting that Franks Grillo's real son played his on screen son Joe, this explains their natural chemistry. Some of my favorite moments are of the swords-woman Guan Yin and every time she kills Frank Grillo says, \"This is Guan Yin and Guan Yin has done this!\" So it's hilarious and satisfying when Frank Grillo's character Roy kills Guan Yin and says, \"This is Roy and Roy has done this!\" Such brilliance.I never really appreciated a Frank Grillo until now.

      "review": "I think that this movie is going to wind people up. Which is hilarious because that is the whole point of the movie to get under peoples skin and make them think.Most people that see this film and dislike it are going to do so because they see them selfs reflected in the people the movie is talking about.I think that this movie will really be an empowering movie for teenage girls. Lots of films try to do this but i think that this movie succeeds where others don't because it doesn't pander to its audience. It was grounded for the most part.Some characters did border on cartoony, which brings me to my biggest issue with the movie. The actor of Mitchell. He wasn't a very good actor anyway but the worst part was how old he looked. He is nearly 30 and i know that this happens in lots of shows and movie and probably he isn't the only one not playing his age in this movie. The issue is that he just stuck out like a sore thumb. Every time he was on screen i was like \"Oh there is an adult man\". It was just incredibly distracting. He was meant to be 16?Another small issue i had was the back end to the second act and the beginning of the third. It seemed to lose its focus and fell off the tracks a little bit for me.Thankfully it finds its way when it begins to wrap the movie up. I think the ending is really great, i do wish it wasn't over as abruptly. I think this could have been fixed by trimming the movie down and then just giving a few of them minutes to the end.This movie was really good and i think that people should see it. I do however think that this movie is going to get a lot of hate and bad reviews because it is a feminist movie so make sure you watch it and support it.",

The buzz surrounding its Oscar chances, the remarkable cast, and mainly its important narrative based on true events were more than enough reasons to generate an undeniably powerful hype. When I watch movies inspired by real people and/or true stories, I want them to teach me about the historical moment they're depicting. I want to finish my viewing sessions and know more than what I did at its beginning. I want the film to be enlightening, thought-provoking, and, most of all, impactful.I'm just a young white man living in Portugal with no previous knowledge of who Fred Hampton was or what he did. The closest I got to learning something about him was during last year's The Trial of the Chicago 7, but that movie wasn't even focused on…",

They are well done.It seems the best is saved for The Conduring editions. Number 1 is a classic, 2 is decent and this, number 3 is a really decent love child.The production and cast are excellent, Vera Farmiga I generally find a pleasure to watch, Patrick Wilson adds well and is comfortable in the role.The film has some good pace, and a decent story, helped as always by the tenuous link to a \"based on a true story\" which always adds to these films. I think it could benefit from the tradtional horror, \"no more that 1.5hrs\", and felt a little long and nearly 2 hours, but not overly under-edited.Overall if you are a horror fan, this will give you what you need, and I suspect will become a pretty popular, Horror in this excellent fanchise.Recommendation: Decent watch for Horror fans.",

Given the talent in the cast it serves as proof that if they're working with rubbish, there's not a lot their talent can do to salvage it. The script is weak, the plotline is thin and McCarthy needs reining in or she needs some new tricks. That Octavia Spencer and Jason Bateman got suckered into this defies understanding. Having just watched Bateman in \"This is where I leave you\", this was embarrassing. If you want a sideways take on superheroes just go back to Hancock or Deadpool - something with a bit of intelligence in it.Just throwing a load of CGI at something doesn't make a good film.It's for hard-core McCarthy fans only.",

To All the Boys: Always and Forever tries it and flops.Though the film is easy to enjoy when watching, it fails once one scratches beneath the surface.Also, what's with romcoms that have relationships with red flags?LDRs are not easy, and this movie ends up setting both main characters for failure. Peter (Noah Centineo) shows that he is not ready for the commitment of an LDR. Lara Jean (Lana Condor) ends up being a passive character willing to give up everything for him. She basically goes to a school that is not her first choice to save the relationship.And getting back together was a cheesy way to wrap things up. It's predictable and leads to no character development throughout the story. No growth at all. What message does this send to its viewers?Also, \"we're not like the other couples.\" No. They stage 1 of a failed LDR. They're one of many HS-to-college relationships that fail within the first year.At least the cinematography of NYC and Seoul…",

Anson Mount is the next big thing. Anson stars in Star Trek's new \"Stranger Worlds\" and captures the role of an \"autistic\", cold blooded killer whose humanity is beginning to seep through very well in The Virtuoso.

To be honest I'd say that if I had watched it with the stereo speakers from my tv, i'd have stopped watching after 20-30 minutes.However that doesn't mean the movie is all about audio -indeed the plot contains interesting revelations- but sound is key here and is very well intertwined the image, so it is a major component of the movie (as opposed to marvel atmos movies for eg) and since it's a \"no exit\" movie (it all happens in one tiny closed space) the picture alone might become boring if no surround sound is there to accompany it (in reality the picture is what accompanies the audio).Now if you've got any 5.1 sound bar or better, the movie is great, but it's not for everyone, indeed being a no exit movie entails that fans of movies like the Avengers and other Marvel movies won't enjoy this as it…",

But it didn't affect my opinion of the movie at all.The plot and ending, to me, was straight forward and good. Denzel's character was a great detective, he became obsessed with a case he couldn't solve, and it caused him to eff up. He happens upon a new case with same MO, and it's a chance to nail the killer. Ramy effs up too, Denzel helps him \"deal with it.\"I think that the writers, editors, and director did their best to insinuate that Leto's character, was indeed the killer... even though there may never have been enough forensic evidence to hold up in court.The ending did leave me thinking... and after…",

I gave it a shot simply because it's a French one and I surmised when it's French, it's always different. And the result? I m happy to have an unexpected twist. The ending is happy-but-sad.

It's a statement I can safely put forth without fearing that I'm making assumptions about the identity of the film's creator, or their intent in creating it.For a film that can so easily be summarized as \"Malcolm and Marie come home, they talk, and they fight\", this picture has a remarkable amount of stirring commentary on the modern film industry and the adjacent world of criticism (not as sagacious as Pixar's Ratatouille, but it'll do). Had I been a more stereotypical critic, I might have asserted that Sam Levinson is using these black characters as a convenient mouthpiece to speak out against the identity politics that suggest a director's racial/sexual/gender attributes meaningfully matter when their work is to be assessed.\"Why would real blxck people (sic) ever say this about The Movement?

The only commonality are some of the characters and the title. They could have just changed the character names and the title and not claim this to be a Tom Clancy film. Either stick with the plot of the books and do them justice or don't claim to do a Tom Clancy film. The plot they did use instead was stale and not what I would expect for a major release. It was more in the direct to DVD league.It also seems like they did not have very good technical advisors... or geographers. The opening scene takes place in a landlocked city and yet Kelly and his team infiltrate via water. The uniforms are also very inconsistent... Greer is wearing a commanders cap in at least one place which is different than what her rank would be.

Franck Khalfoun came on board to direct, with Aja producing.But by 2020 it was all falling apart. Aja kicked Khalfoun out of the director's chair and seized it for himself, while Rapace was dismissed over concerns about 'ideological syncretism.'Following a discussion with investors that Aja later described as 'passionate but not entirely unreasonable, with intermittent screams', Mélanie Laurent was chosen as the new lead.Oxygène won't win any awards for innovation, and leans a trifle too heavily on its meagre cast of just three(!) credited characters, but its heart is in the right place and its cinematography…",

Nobody talks like this here. Pidgin? Sure! But not like they portray.The way they treat kapuna and heiau's would, or should, insult just about every local here.The portrayal of the living conditions all the way to the POS island cars is ludicrous at best.

      "review": "I found this movie to be solidly enjoyable overall. I wouldn't say that it was groundbreaking compared to the average horror move, but there were a couple of things that make it stand out as a fun and interesting watch.The first is the mixture of humour alongside the more fearful and suspenseful elements. This is one of the best things about Sam Raimi's movies-- there is often a surprising blend of fun and darkness in the tone.The second strength of the movie is its focus on the theme of cult mentalities. I liked that it dealt with this topic in a fairly believable fashion that emphasized the human elements of cult dynamics.Ultimately, I got the sense that the movie wasn't trying to take itself too seriously. It provides a reasonably satisfying story and set of character arcs, with some fun scares along the way. As long as a viewer isn't going into the movie and expecting total seriousness, then the movie should make for pretty entertaining viewing.",

You don't care for them and feel no sympathy whatsoever.The most annoying part is that Sam Levinson seems to think is the only one who has seen movies by Kieslowski, or Kubrick's Eyes wide Shut, and endlessly references them and steals ideas, but in the end serving no point and no climax.Zandaya dressed the same way as Nicole Kidman in Eyes wide Shut, (a brilliant movie I have seen 20 times, with easter eggs hidden along the way, unlike this piece of garbage). Levinson referencing the idea of deep conversations and fights in EWS, but unfortunately to no result, no creative meaning, no point. Zendaya peeing in an evening gown in the first scene (hello?! Again Eyes wide shut). But why??? Makes no sense, in the nineties this was groundbreaking to show this in cinemas, but now?? Nothing interesting, nothing new.I've gotten already pretty annoyed by Levinson using the soundtrack from Kieslowski's Double life…",

That was the day Ma told me she couldn't cope and so I moved back home to help look after him. Slowly he got worse. He'd go out early in the morning for walks. Sometimes in just his underwear. Once he managed to leave the house and we ended up having to call the Police. They found him. I started staying awake most nights to watch him. I was already an insomniac. Watching him change from my dad into someone who didn't know me was difficult. The Dr's told Ma that dad needed to go into a 'care' home.…",

There's broad consensus that it's a well-acted and well-shot film despite its shortcomings. With only Days of Heaven under my belt (along with quite a few video essays about Malick's style), the only two rights I have here are to agree that: the comparison made here is valid; and the movie is decent at best. With low-angle, wide lens shots, wind-carried camera coming towards and away from the characters, and detaching the dialogue from the on-screen events that let us hover over the characters, it may well be argued that the technical approach rendered the film said poetic quality and a dream-like feel that implicitly beseech the viewer to give in to the meditative atmosphere that prevails the scene.

Knives Out is a good mystery, Looper has good mystery elements. Lost is a cool and mind-boggling production. Oxygen as a whole, on the other hand, at times is boring, and in other times predictable if not pointless. Take, for example, the fact that she was a clone. Now ask yourself, so what? So what if she's a clone? What would change if she wasn't? Can you see the moral dilemma that answers to these questions may present? That's 24K gold right there and yet the story never actualizes that potential as well as many others. Simply put, character work is too thin to make this movie deserve any score that is higher than a 3 on my IMDb list, but this doesn't mean that it's a bad movie. I certainly…",

      "review": "Greetings again from the darkness. Electrifying. Towering. Ferocious. Choose whatever superlative you prefer to describe Daniel Kaluuya's performance as Fred Hampton, Chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party. Remarkably, Mr. Kaluuya captures Hampton's legendary oratory skills, and his stage presence reminds of Forest Whitaker's Oscar winning turn as Idi Amin in THE KING OF SCOTLAND (2006). And the most stunning part is that this isn't even really a story about Hampton. Director Shaka King, who co-wrote the script with Will Berson from a story by the Lucas brothers, Kenneth and Keith, actually devotes more time to Bill O'Neal, the FBI informant played by LaKeith Stanfield (SHORT TERM 12, 2013).The film opens with a montage of activists in the 1960s, including Bobby Seale, and transitions right into a 1968 FBI symposium where director J Edgar Hoover (Martin Sheen in botched make-up) tells the auditorium full of agents that the Black Panthers are the greatest security threat to…",

      "review": "As any SNL fan knows from the range of her sketches, when Kristen Wiig is on her game, she can be hilarious; other characters of hers can be pointlessly or excessively annoying. In this outing, she and co-star Annie Mumolo play the eponymous gal pals who seem destined to splurge on a big vacation. They lost their jobs and were ousted from their suburban social circle (a nicely satiric group of tea-sipping Karens' Talk Club) on the same day another friend gushes over her recent vacation to the titular Florida destination. And they're off.Unfortunately, their trip coincides with an over-the-top supervillain's elaborate revenge plot against that resort town. She is sort of a distaff Dr. Evil, whose pasty complexion makes Tilda Swinton look like a sun-baked beach bunny. That's not pale-shaming; it's key to the plot. Such as it is.Remember Romy and Michele's High School Reunion from 1997? Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino were a delight as ditzy innocents with a lifelong bond that synced their…",

Sure, the script is unimaginative and the film has no real vision and the action scenes are strictly routine, but the two leads are enormously, effortlessly likable. They make a deeply sweet pair. Maybe the film should have concentrated more on their love story and less on the familiar action aspects of the story. And the violence of a couple of scenes seems rather out of place.

I love Octavia Spencer and Melissa McCarthy; I think they are both incredibly talented women, for that alone, I went in with high expectations and the other reason is that the movie has two plus-size leads and as a plus person myself, I am all for that representation, especially in a superhero movie as this is almost always never the norm. The twisted thing about expectations however is that they usually lead to disappointment and this movie had bucket loads of it.When Melissa McCarthy is a lead in a movie, it would be naÃ¯ve of one not to expect comedy and that is exactly what happened in this movie, her character has little to no character development, her whole arc in the movie is entirely mad up of being the comic relief like any other movie she is in. This is not Melissa's fault because for the most part, it works, I found myself giggling a few times during the movie, I think I was meant to laugh a lot more but…",

      "review": "Another shark tale.. But much better than most. Actually I really enjoy scary shark movies ever since I saw Jaws in the cinema in the 70s. However, most of them are laughable. Not this one. Extremely scary and in my opinion it is just as good as the popular flicks like Adrift.I don't understand why people have given this such a low rating. What more can you expect from a movie about a group of people stranded in the sea being hunted by great white sharks? I've read reviews claiming that the acting is below par but I don't agree. Perhaps Tim Kano's performance was a little bland but not bad enough to drag the movie down a notch. I thought the characters very believable. Kimie Tsukakoshi is totally gorgeous, along with Katrina Bowden so no complaints there. The cinematography was breathtaking, the sharks very scary and the tension certainly had me on the edge of my seat.Just one criticism; in one scene the shark got himself stuck which is unrealistic because sharks have to keep moving…",

An example, in del toros chronos, ron pearlman's character was obsessed with the size of his nose and getting a nose job. It was such an interesting tid bit. In this film there was none of that. The characters just flatly said things that were part of the plot. No banter. No conversations.

The gory part may be disturbing for some people, but the action makes the whole movie. Wrong Turn 2 kills off all the stereotypes, final girls. It's different, brilliant. The whole suspense is based on the surviving of the characters. You think that Mara, the shy supposed protagonist girl will survive but NO she ends axed in the head at the first 1/4 of the movie, while Nina, the goth, bitchy girl survives, along with Jake, the black jock. I really want to make the point on the action. Fight, blood, suspense, you got it. The inbreeds pops out of no-where, anywhere and whenever. The characters are well developed, all with different personalities. For a sequel, well, the only things we get back from Wrong Turn 2003 are Three-Fingers, more insane than ever and the old timer. Nothing very special on this part but still, Wrong Turn 2 is WAY BETTER than Wrong…",

First of all you need to be in the mood to be capable of watch it and be a good experience.\nIn the begging of the movie i was wondering why this couple have no chemistry but quick realized that's kinda of the point. Is a deep hurt couple, they are so full of each other and that need to be reflected someway.\nIs not my favorite movie but i think is a good one, is true and real.\nI can understand why so many people didn't liked it, the script is heavy and and the theme is not easy to watch. You are literally watching a couple fight. They are not likable, they are not perfect, they are just two human beings.\nAbout the performance of the two verry talented actors, i enjoyed, they dont make you feel good but that's the point, because the characters are not well, they are not good people, or bad, they are what they are and the actors put there so well on the screen. They are not trying to you like them, they are fighting to each other, simply as that.\nI…",

This is an extremely grueling film of a couple that rips each other apart emotionally like so many of us. These two don't like each other, even though they think they're madly in love. They're just mad. Foaming at the mouth mad.The cold, exacting bitterness the draws blood almost every time they look at each other out of bed harkins back to Liz Taylor and Richard Burton in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

This isn't without its obstacles as his dad and others, mostly Mikey himself, get in his way of achieving his dream.

Least to say that this was a very cool experience for me and I'm sure the rest of the viewers. This movie is not the best movie out.

      "review": "Back in 1961; Disney adapted the 1056 Novel The Hundred and One Dalmatians and in doing so; crafted a beloved animated classic and introduced the world at large to Cruella De Vil. The film has not only endured but has spawned television series, a direct to video sequel, merchandise, and two live-action versions.Despite being delayed due to the Pandemic; Disney has scheduled the much-anticipated \"Cruella\" for release and I am happy to announce that the film is a Wickedly Delicious new entry into the series.The story follows young Estella as she and her mom plan to start a new life in London in the 1960s. When tragedy strikes, the young girl finds herself on the streets and working a life of crime and grift with fellow street kids Jasper and Horace.Flash forward to the 1970s and Estella (Emma Stone) toils away in a store cleaning while hoping for her shot in the world of fashion. When fate arrives and places Estella in the path of vain, self-centered, and vicious fashion magnate The…",

As for the intrigue, it is very enjoyable. The graciousness and humility that dictated Mr. Brown's (Ralph Fiennes) actions throughout the film were both pleasing and heartbreaking to watch.

Some of the negative reviewers are saying that this film has nothing new to offer, but I disagree. I think that it brings up some good questions about life. I really think that this movie is more than just a run of the mill teen romance. It seems like most teen flicks feel the need to be edgy and trashy. While many enjoy that, it isn't everyone's cup of tea.I enjoyed how colorful it is and I thought that the acting was really good.

They threw in scenes around water or using water in just gimmicky ways that made no impact on the film. They have a shootout that looks like they were trying to imitate the Tom Clancy Rainbow Six video game. It's like they never actually read the book they just read the cliff notes and took it in a completely make it up as you go last minute piece of garbage assignment that they didn't really want to do.If you have not read the book do not read it before watching this dumpster fire you WILL be disappointed.

With the Warrens looking to save a man on death row after supposedly killing an individual while possessed by a demon. Without going into spoilers the plot shakes things up a bit from the previous two films with the likes of Satanic cults and more or a detective style approach.I personally would of loved to see more of a focus on the court side of the case and the reaction of the defendants plea, it would of been a really refreshing direction for this film but what we get still isn't bad.The Warrens are still great in this film with both Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga having a real chemistry on screen and…",

Others will raise their fist and proclaim they fight for the right of those abused and violated. Both sides will claim they know the truth. I am not surprised by man's inhumanity. Indeed, my faith calls it original sin. The difference being, I believe we are all capable of it. But my faith also believes in deliverance and hope, responsibility and the power of redemption. This film does a remarkable job of representing this man's story. The performances are flawless. The storytelling is compelling. The warning is important.

As USA Today critic Brian Truitt wrote, \"Because Daniels filmed her singing live, 'Strange Fruit' and other old songs feel vibrant and resonant.\" What other movie songs are performed and recorded live? It is ground-breaking. Sumptuous sets contrast with no-frills emotions of Billie Holiday and her entourage. . . Costumes, furnishings, and production values noted in the mainstream press would display well on large theater screens, the way director Lee Daniels intended, but watching online has its advantages. Subtitles and the ability to rewind rescue the many one-liners of the fast-paced dialogue. The United States vs. Billie Holiday is no light popcorn fare. It is an intense and dark journey of celebrity targeted by authorities determined to make an example, selfish hangers-on, drug pushers, and abusive men. A light romance fantasy conjured from artistic license counters the harsh reality documented by the film . . .…",

      "review": "Judas and The Black Messiah (2021)Two things that come to mind when hearing the name Judas: Jesus Christ and betrayal. Judas loved Jesus, he believed in his ideas, he was his close friend and yet he betrayed him for 30 silver coins. After being arrested by the FBI, Bill O'Neal finds himself joining the Black Panthers as a spy. Initially, he doesn't care about their struggle as he is in it purely to avoid incarceration. However, once Fred Hampton's revolutionary ideas manage to crawl into his mind, Bill finds himself at a moral crossroad.On one side, he likes staying out of jail while getting paid by the FBI; on the other, he feels the rebellious spirit coursing through his veins as he gets closer and closer to The Black Messiah and LaKeith plays that part to perfection. Daniel Kaluuya gives a volcanic performance as Fred Hampton and yet it felt like a miscasting despite his tremendous energy. The real 21 year old Fred looked like a man of knowledge with wisdom beaming out of his eyes; the same couldn't be felt about Daniel who is also 10 years older. Furthermore, instead of delving deeper into Fred's life, the movie limits his time while choosing to focus on shootouts.What is important in any revolutionary film, specially if it aims to be realistic, is to portray both sides of the coin and I think this movie doesn't achieve that objective. Instead of focusing on counter politics, Bill's motivations or Fred's backstory, the film runs all over the place as events and characters are introduced without any development simply for the sake of adding layers and creating noise.Despite losing it's focus, the movie successfully establishes a core idea which will hopefully inspire peole to read about these events. Aesthetically, the film felt immersive as the revolutionary spirit was flowing through the screen; Kendrick Lamar's Hiii Power would have fit nicely here. Giving credit where credit is due, the movoe stayed true to the title by managing to make it all about Judas and his weakness. On the day when he was tasked with the ultimate betrayal, Bill burst into tears just as Judas cried when he had to betray Jesus and in a way, that felt poetic.Movies.shmovies on Instagram for Movies and Tv shows",

And while she gave an enjoyable, Oscar nominated performance, the film really sold Holiday, and especially her music, short. It should be noted that most of the lyrics of Strange Fruit were omitted. So much so that I didn't even 'get' that song when watching the film upon its release.But this film puts Strange Fruit right, although it takes an agonizing hour and a half to hear it. But it does little else right. It's a huge, huge disappointment. Within the first 5 minutes we have terrible acting (Jimmy's mom, clearly dubbed), a very kludgey script, and lots and lots of ho-hum-ness. Hard to believe that this was directed by the same person who did The Butler and Empire.It seems as if the director was trying to make a highly stylized, tongue in cheek film about Holiday's legal and political problems, and thus a less than obvious statement about America's sketchy racial…",

Narratively, it's not always as memorable as one would hope, but the strong performances and careful direction carry the film home at the end of the day and overall craft something certainly worth watching.Anthony Hopkins is undoubtedly terrific here. He is able to convey both frailty yet genuine shock and empathy, while trying to better understand those around him that even he regularly connects with. Colman's performance is compassionate yet multi-layered, conveying clear emotional depth.

The book is about him saving a drugged out prostitute and then her getting killed which brings him to a place of full on revenge. Also the story flashes back to his time in Vietnam as snake. This would have been a good story. Instead Amazon and this director did what numerous others have done and had some shady government operators do the main character dirty while killing his team mates and his wife. This movie stole the plot line of numerous movies while stealing the title from Tom Clancey.

I've missed him these past few years with very dialed down or tone deaf roles he's been given. He was free to basically have fun... AS LONG AS HE DIDN'T SPEAK. I'm not kidding, he has no lines in the entire movie. I imagine the film only had enough money in the budget to get him on set, and not enough to get him to speak. The plot is basically Five Nights at Freddy's but the walmart brand and intended to appeal to a much larger audience than 2010 zoomers. That said, the action sequences are fun, but don't carry the film far enough to be enjoyable. The characters are ignorant to an annoying point. The cops, and basically whole town are in on the scheme when they could just as easily nuke the building, or shoot up the animatronics. That'd be too easy. Instead, it takes 1 teenage girl with a pocket knife and 1 mute 60 year old to take on 8 or so 90's power rangers villain…",

They used big words that no one ever use in a fight. There whole part about the filmmaker complaining from the critics is so forced.. i felt it was so irrelevant to the whole story.\nThe whole of black and white, is kind of forced so people would feel that it is a deep artistic movie, while in fact i felt it was so shallow.\nFor example, marriage story was a movie about couples arguing and was so authentic than this one, we would be lessening marriage story if we compare it to this one.\nZendaya's acting was disturbing.. i felt she was also forcing the drama, and forcing the reactions, there was something so weird about the way she talks and reacts.At the end i guess that if this movie is divided into separate stories, in a separate short film,…",

There is not much \"story\" here and while I thought our \"Janitor\" would get some backstory himself, this never happens ... as the filmmakers say, it is in the tradition of the Western movies ... the silent, nameless \"avenger\", who comes to clean town ... or hallways/rooms/bad souls.Having said all that, the movie is as insane as you may think when you read what it is about. And what better choice than Nicolas Cage to play the main/lead role? Exactly - you may have issues with the twenty something year old being attracted to him - but it's a movie and it's Nicolas Cage and ... I mean is that really the main issue you have here?

The storyline is unrealistic, and there's \"subtle\" political messages that are frankly insulting to anyone who can think rationally. The action is half decent, the only reason I was able to finish the movie was based on the love I have for the Tom Clancy book Without Remorse. The writers just don't fully understand what sort of character they are writing about, and who the audience is. They should've done more research before writing the movie... or just Read the Book and made the movie based off of it. Bottom line: don't waste your time with this movie.",

For the first third it looks like we are heading for Lady Chatterley's Lover territory with posh lady (Carey Mulligan) eyeing up the digger (Ralph Fiennes) until his wife turns up. Then it looks like it's going to be a battle royal between Fiennes and the Establishment, but that is headed off.It's 1939 so the Second world War is on its way.

      "review": "Yes, this movie is the best content I have seen so far this year. Its major theme is the fleeting state of life where we see characters faced with existential worries and what they leave behind, who cares at the moment and how important it is for the future. The Dig (the treasure, the findings and what it all means to both present and future) exemplifies that plus other characters going through the similar worries either through health or by and large when they're faced with an imminent threat of the war. It also has smaller themes that is so beautifully interwoven to the larger story.A beautiful story and i am intrigue to read the source material.",

No Viking treasure will free these souls from the inevitability of war.The cast all capture that necessary sense of fragility, as if they could all be snuffed out in an instant. Mulligan's Pretty is a delicately handled performance, as a woman processes grief and loneliness. Similarly Fiennes' Brown is stubborn but a pained character.",

The jazzy score also serves the story greatly. John David Washington and Zendaya kill it - that scene were Zendaya had the knife made my jaw drop. That's how you subvert expectations. The film teaches about the importance of showing gratefulness in a relationship and being appreciative for the small things your partner does for you which, personally, is something I need to be reminded of often. Some people just assume your partner knows your appreciative, but some people want you to tell/show them. I really appreciate the film for spreading that message.However, the film is not without its flaws. Because the movie is very much dialogue-driven, it can a bit exhausting at times. My bigger problem with the film, though, is the lack of nuance and subtlety it carried with the multiple anti-critic monologues. The first one, I didn't mind,…",

So it pains me to score a film he is in a 1 out of 10.What bothered me were monotonous robotic voiceover narrator. It sounds like Audible book-reading voiceover. During the diner scene when Abbie Cornish (The Waitress) brings over a carafe of fresh coffee to the table were Anson Mount (The Virtuoso) is sitting, I wanted to reach for the carafe myself. Wrong table darling Abbie, bring it here.The voiceover delivery is cringey and ruins the story. Because most of the actors were talking in this fashion, the director had to be to blame. This film has some excellent actors. Yet they all deliver their lines in a synthetic audible robot monotone. I sort of understand what the director was going after, but it didn't work. It didn't have the comedic feel to it. A focus group should have tested out this film before it was released.Another thing, to say this film was completely predictable is an understatement. This film began its downward spiral from the opening scene. What was the director thinking using this type of delivery with seasoned actors? You cannot do this bad a job with Sir Anthony Hopkins and Eddie Marsan on your cast! How did you mess this up? Wow, just umm, WOW. Even amateur hidden-cam porn has better sex scenes than this film.

This is greatly helped by Melanie Laurent's fantastic central performance. Pretty good story, lovely visuals and score and, as I said previously, a great central performance elevate what could have been mediocre fare to some decent sci-fi with a nice emotional payoff.

Gadot and Pascal try and maybe have moments that don't suck.

Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is exactly the same, except it has more gore and absolutely no atmosphere. This straight-to-DVD sequel is nothing special, and is more of an action/horror movie than a straight out horror movie. First off, it has a fairly fast pace, meaning that characters have a standard introductory scene, and if they are lucky enough, a two minute scene revealing their past and why we should feel sorry for them. Secondly, the acting is bad, well, Erica Leerhsen is quite good, she does a decent job as the heroine but no one else is interesting in the slightest. Furthermore, the story is nothing to write home about, and in a film like this, it really doesn't need to be Oscar material. Also, the dialogue is atrocious, with way too many bad one-liners and lame attempts at humour. However, not all is bad, for all the gorehounds out there, this…",

Sympathy jobs. Then I looked at the list of bad films he has put out in the past. Yup. Chalk another one up. I will be sure to check the director next time before I watch a McCarthy film.Octavia Spenser looked awkward and out of place, like she couldn't understand how she got in this film and she just wanted to flee.

This film doesn't have that formula. The reviews that say 10/10 should be required to answer a real \"why\" question in order to be visible by others.My \"why\" for a 2/10: falls flat on many scenes that could have been funny if the right lead was cast. McCarthy as a dumb but strong character paired with a woman that seems to lack any and all comic ability definitely delivers as is. That is- it doesn't. Spencer is a great actress. We have seen her delivery in dramas. It makes no sense in this case when really all we needed as a humorous lead allowing McCarthy to be the comic relief she's good at as a supporting character or one that can be trashed and get laughs.A quick search for \"Spy\" is a good resume for McCarthy's success.

Mount still implemented his aura when he played the fierce character in \"Hell on Wheels\" as totally inappropriate. A hitman or assassin should not show his intensity everytime when he was in a social contact with the common people. He just looked so different and stand out among regular people, he didn't blend in but a rooster among hens; that's an absolute NO NO in the first place. He's so intense and looked so obviously intense with animosity to others, only made him look so unprofessional. Then again, signed up Abbie Cornish to play the diner's waitress was another misstep unforgivable, but even so, she's more looked like a seasoned virtuoso than Mount, who played it. But Cornish really has to watch out her weight, it seems a bit of out of control and readily to explode. Hawkins, well, this movie got to borrow some heavy wt. Actor to fool viewers to think that this movie would be great, but not in the least. He's not a magician or savior to salvage a terrible screenplay with limited budget for a B movie and, I'd guess a large part of the budget was paid to him for his participation. As to Mr. Mount, your performance was just too 1 dimensional, you couldn't just bring your Hell on Wheels characteristics into any other roles you played. You're a handsome dude, but it could only bring you so far.Summary: Don't waste your time like I did; don't bother.",

      "review": "This movie make zero sense other than they wanted Tom Clancy in the title of of the movie. It literally has nothing to do with the books or the characters.One, John Kelly aka Clark's wife and daughter are not only alive, but his daughter is married to his second in command Ding Chavez. In the books, the origin of John Clark, has him in his mid to late 20's with his story ending with him being married to Pam and having a daughter on the way. The Rainbow Group happens a little over 20 years later with his daughter being married to his younger second in command.Currently, John Clark is in his early 70's and is in charge of his new group of operators , \"The Campus\" and Jack Ryan Jr. Is one of his agents.Nothing about the movie makes sense as it relates to the ongoing books.While I appreciate they have to make changes, they would have been better off setting this up in the late 70's or early 80's.Spoiler but not reallyThe movie on it's own, regardless of the books was also ridiculous on it's own. How many people gather around in a street while an active sniper is shooting? How many cops simply walk around in an active shooter sequence when two of their own get shot. I mean, just meandering around.",

With the number of highbrow story elements compressed into 100 mins (causality loops, DNA coded missing mass, Egyptian mythology and catastrophism) it would have been very easy to overwhelm and confuse the audience with too many ideas - but Boss Level doesn't. The story is well told, very well paced and seems to make a point of intentionally evolving from chaotic and complex to calm and clear. Clive Ventor's plan is horrific but logical and it's eventually revealed that Roy Pulver really only ever had one job from the start. When he devises his final, final, final, FINAL plan, despite everything that's happened, it makes perfect sense and also provides a valuable message about not giving up - even when you know the situation is completely hopeless.\nWhat could have been just a nihilistic Groundhog Day shoot 'em up turns out to be something far more intelligent and emotionally engaging.

The scary comes from the scenarios, a plausible way out for a questionably evil trapped person... but when the victim is unlikable and the choices are both just as bad, when it's always death or mutilation, that's not intense. The killer (no spoilers) is exactly who it has to be... ie there is no second guessing. I figured it out 30 min in because of lazy writing and editing that shows too much. Also, be sure to show every death scene... that is so annoying when one is missing. Like, duh.",

The characters were alright, aside from one which really annoyed the crap out of me! The film however was short at 1 hour & 21 minutes, but felt longer due to it mostly being the group moaning & talking to each other while floating endlessly.But my main hate towards this film is the sexism. All the Male characters die & all the females live (how original), once again it's typical in the 2020's that men can't be hero's & save the day, cause women apparently don't need men (who are treated as useless in films like this) to save them from danger, how typical! How EmPowErInG! How Wo0Ke! Seriously? Why do films have to be like this? Can't good films be made anymore? Apparently not in 2021 or the 2020's for that matter...!Overall, terrible film! 1/10.",

There are just a few parts I don't understand why they were included. Two of the girls kiss once and its never addressed or developed. I understand that they don't want to take away from the overall theme, but to me it just felt like a token scene, like they threw it in to seem \"woke\".

      "review": "U.S. vs Billie Holiday is an excellent yet unabashedly realistic and insightful fictional portrayal of the life, loves, and tribulations endured by Lady Day, a victim of the circumstances of her upbringing and personal demons. It seems almost incongruous to include Ms Andra Day's jaw-dropping performances (singing and acting), perfect sets, and period accoutrements with the dark American realities of racial prejudice, segregation, lynchings, and Billie Holiday's ongoing, unethical, no holds barred, racially-motivated persecution by the US government. For singing a song!The U.S. vs Billie Holiday is a great must-see film that I, a Black American, almost passed on because I am wearying of one of the painful shrouded negative truths of African American history being constantly illuminated for entertainment purposes: famous and revered Black American icons (Billie Holiday, Fred Hampton, Malcolm X), persecuted by the US government while simultaneously betrayed (sometimes murdered) by their…",

Literally, every film directed, written, and/or produced by Falcone has the famous actress in the lead role, all exploring subgenres of comedy. From romance (Superintelligence) to crime (The Happytime Murders), without forgetting a road trip (Tammy), now comes the time for Thunder Force, a dive into the highly profitable superhero circle. However, I don't believe the couple's real goal is to deliver a globally liked movie. Actually, I firmly defend that their purpose is to provide the most nonsensical piece of storytelling possible, hoping that viewers find it entertaining enough.Directors, screenwriters, actors, and every other crew member... a vast majority aspire to deliver a groundbreaking masterpiece. A film recognized by everyone as \"remarkable cinema\". Something worthy of many…",

William Sadler, who plays as Father Hagan, I've always seen in some movies here and there, and he's great too. And Cricket Brown who plays Alice, God, I really hope to see her in more films. She's outstanding! You can't go wrong with producer Sam Raimi when he's behind a horror movie. Honestly seeing a creepy, satanic version of Mary was a pretty different and interesting concept.",

Thunder Force belongs to the latter one.Spencer and McCarthy don't have chemistry as soromance/BFF, the acting direction does not exist in this movie, the story is kind of lame and weak, powerless. The directing is as standard as any mid-budget fantastic flick, with the same shots, the same camera movements, the same editing, the same CGIs, the same whatever.I honestly thought that most of the people would be wrong about the negative reviews, but after watching Thunder Force, all I can say is that…",

Very strange omission, especially for international audiences who must wonder at the end what all the fuss was about. Not enough to have a character yell that they proved Anglo Saxons weren't cavemen. Likely revisions in the actual history, particularly regarding ages of participants at the time (Carey Mulligan) sent us scurrying to Google to find out what was true, and what was mayonnaise.

      "review": "I wanted to LOVE this movie. The story of Fred Hampton, like Huey Newton and the Black Panthers, needs to be told. It is so relevant and important, particularly the emphasis on socialism and the rainbow coalition. Could not be more timely.But the execution of this movie is awful. It is boring, the character of Fred Hampton is poorly developed, too much emphasis on the Judas character, and worst of all the dialogue is very hard to understand. Seriously, for all those people giving 10 stars, please go back and watch Malcolm X. If this movie deserves 10 stars, then Spike Lee's movie deserves 10,000 stars.Watch One Night In Miami instead - absolute masterpiece. I wish they had got King to direct this movie as well.",

Hope so!I'm a huge Liam Nieson fan. Unfortunately, he seemingly will forever be in \"Taken\" remakes of various varieties. Even worse, BAD Taken remakes with terrible plots. Well, if you've found this review, you've also found 'The Marksman' (or, Taken 10).Another unfortunate outcome of this movie is the predictable acting. Liam Nieson plays the role which they hired him and in true fashion, he does it very well. But, we've seen this role about a million times now. I like Katheryn Winnick as an actress and would like to see her in more films. However, like Nieson, her acting chops can't fill the gap of a boring, pointless character who has no real purpose. Waste of talent IMO. And, I think that's the underlying story here = BORING characters and predictable Hollywood plots.This story feels recycled and we've seen this one over and…",

And yes, \"The Seventh Day\" was certainly watchable, but that was about it. It was not an overly great movie, despite of having a nice enough twist to the storyline.Nay, the movie just suffered from being a bit too monotonous. There wasn't enough pacing to the storyline and what did happen throughout the course of the movie just felt somewhat generic and not overly interesting.

It doesn't matter that there's the military, espionage and geopolitical conspiracies involved in the Tom Clancy variation on the formula; it's always the same thing. The baddie and his red herring are so obvious that one of them might as well be wearing a black hat. But, sure, the action is standard, if darkly lit, and Michael B. Jordan fits the part of a muscular star to recognizably pose between the rest of the interchangeable tropes. Maybe you'll even find \"Without Remorse\" a bit fun with him not playing by the rules, out for revenge as he is. For crying out loud, we even get a mid-credits scene setting up a franchise.When a movie is this dull, I start desperately looking for something to be worth my attention. One character makes a point regarding the Cold War having brought Americans together, whereas now without a common enemy one half sees the other half as the enemy. That comes too late to matter, though. There's also the business of Jordan's character telling his enemies to say his murdered wife's name. That got me thinking about the SayHerName campaign, but the picture doesn't do anything with its star being an African American, and in one sequence he takes out an entire squad of Russian police officers who are just doing their jobs.

      "review": "Andra Day is solid in what is ultimately a wildly underwhelming story that should really be far more moving than it is. The United States vs Billie Holiday is a biopic that feels so recycled and stale it's hard to believe. Swap a few details around and you basically have \"Judy\" all over again, an underwhelming film about a misunderstood and victimized female musician with the only saving grace being in the performance of the titular lead. Judy is an underwhelming film and so was this. Where the US vs BH really falters though is in how aggressively it hammers away at all the same old points again and again.Throw in the constant blacksploitation thing, which is likely 100% accurate for the story and a subject that still deserves to be discussed but is delivered with all the emotional potency of of stale bread, makes this feel like such a try hard for Oscar season. I mean, it follows the recipe well enough of a period piece about a misunderstood genius struggling with substance abuse…",

The question is how did she look back? Did she look back longingly, in disgust, in amazement, in regret, with nostalgia, in anticipation that nothing will be better moving forward, was she excited for the next chapter, was she angry, was she sad, was she happy? Well, she was turned to a pillar of salt so we will never know.\nAs for this movie it is an example/warning of when we look back, and how we use it. Similar to the scripture I feel that this movie is advising us to be careful when looking back. If we dig up the past…",

While most straight-to-video sequels are lacking in many ways, this one shines forth with originality and vision. Lynch's previous work was in the world of music videos, and he transitions very well to the horror style. The fact this film has a reality TV element to it may help, but those are not the film's strongest parts.We're treated to a woman who is literally chopped in half (vertically) by an ax, a scene of an inbred mutant masturbating... and plenty of cannibalism.

This was AMAZING.A modern folktale on the relationship with humans and nature and the fight to be harmonious when it'll never happen.Words cannot explain how CRAZY this movie is. The editing, the visuals, but most of all the SOUND. The score and the sound effects in this are just next level. Half of the movie consists of some of the most insanely annoying yet most uncomfortable things you've ever heard. They're literally just frequencies and noises but after hearing them it's just stuck in your head.The visuals...wow the visuals. 3 different scenes caused me to completely cringe and I NEVER cringe at body horror. Never have, except for those 3 scenes. I have 0 clue how they caused it to be so realistic...so visceral\nAlso the editing and the psychedelic-inspired (obviously) make you feel like you took a handful of mushrooms (pun intended, if you've seen the movie). It's utterly mesmerizingThe…",

He was such an atrociously bad actor throughout the entire film that it genuinely felt like a school project at times. It wasn't until the first cut to black during a tense moment that I realized this is a Lifetime made for TV type movie. With that taken into consideration, it held my attention well enough. What trumps even the poor acting and cinematography was the method of story telling. They attempt the classic move where they show a scene from near he end of the movie and then jump back 20 years earlier, slowly building back up to that moment to continue from it. The problem is that this particular scene shows us that any attempt at escape we see throughout the first hour will be unsuccessful, killing any tension and momentum. This was based off the harrowing real story of Elisabeth Fritzl, and more justice could have been done with it in the film realm.",

It is one of the most stereotypical, dull, boring, re-treads about the US Mexican order and the cartels. This film doesn't really offer anything new to that very unique genre and trust me there are so many better films than this one.The only thing saving this film is Liam Neeson, without him this would be a horrifying disaster. There is an attempt to create a relationship with his character and the little kid but its just boring. I just hope this is the last time I see Mr Neeson in an action film being the prominent star. That time has past now, please move on and go back to being involved in some great drama or some ensemble films. I still think he is a terrific actor…",

And finally the acting and dialogue in this film are simply laughable, several clearly dubbed lines and the emotions displayed in scenes where somebody is meant to be shot or feeling pain are so fake it hurts. The sound of shots being fired is better than any comedy I've seen all year, little pew pew pinging noises, it's hilarious.

      "review": "If ever there was a film that had no right being as good as it was, it's Wrong Turn 2. A sequel to an unwatchably bad 2000s slasher that soars in every way that it's predecessor sinks. Not only that, it completely redeems and fully realized the botched premise of another terrible slasher film, Halloween: Resurrection. The film's blend of found footage reality TV with over-the-top slasher gore is funny, creepy and genuinely unpredictable. And it's a sequel to Wrong Turn of all things!The performances are a great deal of fun all around. Erica Leerhsen is great actress who's unfortunately been saddled with mostly terrible movies (Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre '03, e.t.c) that she usually ends up being the best part of. Here, she more than proves herself as a phenomenal lead actress and one of the best anti-final girls I've ever seen. Her Nina is relatable, ferocious and surprisingly complex for a slasher lead and Leerhsen brings a great combination of grit…",

      "review": "The summery says;\n'An archaeologist embarks on the historically important excavation of Sutton Hoo in 1938.'\nAnd for the first half of the movie, this is true. And it's exciting. And well acted.\nBut when they introduce Lily James,Peggy Piggott, the story changes. And as of now I still don't know to what. I like Lily James. I was excited to see her pop up because I didn't realize she was in it. But I still can't find a reason for her character. Other then, she was lonely? I was watching a movie about excavating, and then I wasn't. Very weird. Her story arc had no bearing on, well, the story. Then to find out, the character she fools around with is fictional. What? So now we know. Someone wanted her in it, so they made up a story line. With a guy going to war. Except, he wasn't real. So now I'm doubly sure her character was disposable.\nFor those who didn't see two different movies like me. I envy you. If they kept on track with the two main characters, Basil Brown and Edith Pretty, I just know I would have given it ten stars. But sadly, seeing a pretty face that has no purpose, well, has no purpose.\nOh wait, she did find a little ring or something. SMH",

The first movie was great from start to finish. Everything from the look, plot, acting, script etc.. was 110%. The movie relied on pure suspense, instead of pouring endless amounts of blood in your face - Wrong Turn 2: Dead End, has pretty much the opposite, on all of the above.This movie could have been a great sequel, but instead, it comes off cheap, second rate and merely lack luster to it's first. This is probably due to the fact that no person(s) from the first movie were involved with the project - and I can understand why.The movie starts off well, with a great opening - possibly better than the first opening, but after 15 minutes passed I quickly realised It wasn't going to be anything on the original.

While this is ultimately true, I do tend to love sci-fi and a couple of other genres more than the rest. I find sci-fi to be one of the most creative filmmaking sources, partially due to the infinite potential of its storytelling. From extraterrestrial life to an exploration of deep space, our world knows so little of what's beyond our planet, which makes the respective genre a perfect framework for imaginative, unique fiction. Voyagers features an interesting cast, but Neil Burger was behind the disappointingly hollow Divergent saga, so I couldn't help but go in with very low expectations.Even anticipating a tough watch, I never thought Voyagers would be a contender for one of the worst flicks of the year.

I feel like it could have been longer though with the breakup dragged out longer, but I assume it closely follows the books which I haven't read.For anyone who has had a high school romance and had to go through the ups and downs, this is like a trip down memory lane. When you're young and in love it's the whole world at the time and it's innocent and scary and hard. These movies bring me back to being 17 and thinking about \"forever\".",

So, is that a good thing or a bad thing? Lionsgate presents this new space drama written and directed by Neil Burger. He stated, \"It's about human nature in a vacuum - who we are at our core.\"I really loved Neil Burger's film Limitless and highly recommend it. The TV series off-shoot was also very good. They both take a look at how drugs affect the human psyche and how we see the world. I also thought his Divergent franchise was entertaining, so I was excited to see what he was going to do with this movie.THINGS I LIKED:\nTye Sheridan leads the pack of hormonal teens in space. I really liked him in Ready Player One and he has even been in the recent X-Men: Apocalypse movies. He started his acting career at a very young age with roles in movies like Mud and Joe.

You can feel the work that has been put in while making the film, a sense of community and collaboration unlike much else. It's nice to watch a film focusing on skating where the people behind the camera actually understands skating and how to accurately portray it. North Hollywood takes place in a specific environment but its core is just as universal and timeless as any other coming-of-age tale and for many viewers, this will be their life/story finally told on screen. I'll leave the rating 9/10 as of now since I feel like I need to watch the film a second time to really settle on a rating. However, just going by my heart, it's a win across all boards.UPDATE: Well, I just watched it again and I'm just going to bump this up to a 10/10. There's so much heart and vibrancy in this film and I'm just so glad projects like this actually can get made today in this…",

      "review": "Despite not being a huge fan of FNAF, the concept is pretty cool, but to make it a good movie takes dedication, a good script, a talented director and a decent budget. \"Willy's Wonderland\" has none. The opening sequence starts with Nicholas Cage who is 60, pretending to be on his late 30's driving a sports car and has an unhealthy obssesion with energy drinks. He has no lines during the entire movie, I guess he's supposed to play the silent protagonist in video games since obviously this movie is inspired from a video game, but it just doesn't work. His character has no backstory and gets boring since he doesn't get any character development as the movie goes on. He also seems to have some sort of superhuman strength as he is the only one who is capable of destroying any of the animatronics with little effort. The other characters in the movie are either there just to be killed or for some plot exposition. And some of them do REALLY stupid things! There is one moment in the movie where two teens have sex inside the \"Willy's Wonderland\" while being perfectly aware that killer animatronics are watching them and are about to kill them, one of the teens even say \"let's give them a show!\" Absolute cringe. As for the animatronics, it initally starts good with them being pretty creepy and staring at the actors when they're not looking, but once they start talking it goes downhill from there. Most of their dialogue consists of insulting the characters with crude language that is neither scary or funny. Having them not talk would have made them scarier. The special effects are cheap too. Some of the animatronics are clearly people in costumes, and it really ruins the movie's concept. Overall I don't recommend this film.",

He works at a Psychiatry Institute and she's a local Real Estate Agent. An early scene shows adoring mother Grace driving their young son to hockey practice.

There is no lead in to why the main character is of any importance for us to listen to him explain his trade craft.I thought the convergence of players in the diner was similar to the Hateful Eight but they never allowed that tension to grow. Instead they played the story out in various locations and the movie lost all its potential.The woman has a nice nude scene but that alone is not enough to recommend this movie. Out of respect for Anthony Hopkins' past roles and the 10 minutes he gets in this movie I won't say anything about his performance. If it was any other actor I would have trashed him.

Later on he drives a vehicle into water off a pier and sinks with the car and again holds his breath longer than a sea turtle could and escapes. All this while evading bullets from high powered rifles throughout the movie. And of course the plot is typical and easy to figure out. And much of the shooting occurs in Russia and he never gets caught. Other than that, well its ridiculous in my opinion.",

So far, I think there's not one single Clancy \"based\" movie that deserves the signature.Without Remorse, IMHO, is the most engaging of Clancy's novels. It would make great material for a 10 episode series, and then a basis to keep on with the Ryan saga. Might make a terrific serialized program; one season per novel, demanding that the producers kept in the true narrative of the novels; so much material there.Returning to the film, it might entertain you; heavy action, completely unbelievable.

      "review": "Another year, another Netflix action film is here to watch, this time it is Outside The Wire and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a drone pilot have to team up with android officer in an attempt to save the world.Main Character\nAnthony Mackie plays Leo the android who I thought did a good job here and bought quite a bit to the role. He is basically the tough mentor and he does it pretty effectively, his character goes all over the place in the final act and it comes close to ruining it but it doesn't take away from his decent performance. But there is another main character Harp played by Damson Idris and I did not like this character at all. He does something at the beginning of the film that makes him unlikeable from the start and he never recovered for me and I never came around to care about him.Supporting Characters\nThe supporting cast don't offer anything because the film doesn't try to make that happen. The bad guy is as generic and dull as you can imagine and everybody else in the film is barely here and they aren't given anything to really work with. The film only really cares about its too main protagonists and forsakes every other character here.Story\nThe story is serviceable at best, I like the fact that Mackie's character was an android and how this world uses synthetics in general was pretty interesting and could have and should have been explored more. The film just doesn't do a good enough job of exploring it's themes and messages and the final act is so ridiculous and basically feels like it comes out of nowhere in order for the film to try and feel unique. Also the ending feels very abrupt, I don't know why lately it feels like films I watch are ending abruptly and this one is no different not answering all the questions it needs to.Script\nThe script is fine, Mackie spits out some pretty good dialogue and the story does have a few good elements. Though like its story the script falls very short and tries to be more interesting then it is and it could have done with either focusing more on the interesting parts or just be a full on action film.Style\nThe style of the film has some pretty decent action scenes that do show the horror of war. But the film doesn't do enough with what it has, probably because there wasn't the budget that the film really needed for something so ambitious.Overall\nOverall, this is a below average action film that doesn't do anything to change up the game and really make it stand out and is one you can happily skip.",

The premise of the film sees an elite soldier go on the hunt after his wife is killed.Main Character\nOver the last few years Michael B Jordan has become a real film star and that shows here as he manages to add a little bit to this completely bland character. Jordan just has the presence of a movie star and it is sometimes exciting to see him take down bad guys are here. But the issue is that this character is incredibly dull and boring, I never once cared about him and his motivations despite the fact I clearly should. A weaker actor then Jordan would have been totally useless but he manages to save it a little bit.Supporting Characters\nThis film has an impressive supporting cast.

There's no story here, it's simply a \"people walk into forest and stuff happens\" kind of film. We hear about a virus pandemic, but it's never referred to outside of the first act. There is, however, a dump truck full of exposition as the third act begins, almost as if it's a completely different film?!

Henry is the only person in this movie that brought a true believability to his role, and played it extremely well. Unfortunately his character was short-lived, meeting a demise very early into the film.I find it amusing that, with all the high-tech SFX and camera work that went into this destined-for-the-bargain-bin movie, that the one shining star of the film came from someone (Rollins) whose profession is far removed from the big screen.If you like Henry Rollins, then you will like this film and his…",

I kept watching this movie only because I wanted to finish the series. It was definatly the worst film of the series. Things I am glad I never did in high school: 1) have a high school boyfriend- your brain isn't even equipped to deal with all the actual relationship drama, let alone actual problems. 2) let a boy determine where I want to go to school let alone feel indepted to that boy- the entire plot was her feeling bad that she wasn't going where he was. 3) fall in love in high school- it never lasts, get your crap together and find someone like minded, this movie gives and unrealistic veiw of romance and must have been written by a teenager.When you have lived a little and experience REAL relationships you understand stuff like this is garbage. It's not cute. It's boarder line controling. And, WHRRE THE HECK ARE THE PARENTS. Geez. 2 hours I will never get back.",

Being from Hawaii and now living in the mainland it was fun to watch this movie... yes it's very much like goonies but the infusion of the Hawaii culture, language and folk lore made it all the more special. The night marchers story was very similar to what we were taught growing up as was the pidgin and infusion of Hawaiian words. Loved that their home was authentic with glass jalousie windows and tons of wood paneling. The filming of most of the film appears to be in Hawaii and they even have Halona beach from \" from here to eternity\" in it. The cast looks like the majority of them are from Hawaii which is refreshing considering the majority of the tv shows filmed in Hawaii have lead characters who are not from Hawaii and butcher the Hawaiian Pidgin and culture. The family relationship is realistic and my kids could identify with the siblings. It was.clean and light hearted. I would recommend to anyone, but if your not from Hawaii put the closed captioning on for the Hawaiian words. 💛💛",

It has nothing to do with the book's plot or characters, it's not set in the same time period, and I'm pretty sure these people made a generic action movie, but they were afraid that nobody would see it, so they changed the main character's name, slapped poor Tom Clancy's name on it (because Tom won't object to it ever since he stopped needing oxygen) and hoped that people would watch it based on false titling. I hate this movie for that reason. If they had called this movie literally anything else, I would have given it at least 6 stars. It's a 6 star movie, but being labeled as \"Tom Clancy's Without Remorse\", 1 star is too much. But I couldn't tell you how much you shouldn't expect to actually see a faithful adaptation of a great novel without at least putting a star on. So.....be warned.

There was a point in the movie that I like to call a \"false ending\" where they leave room for a sequel but instead of ending the movie, it keeps going to the next chapter.

He goes from charming and funny to menacing to wholly lost in seconds. From man to child on a dime. It's a powerful rumination on a terrifying disease, bolstered by Sir Tony at his finest, a strong supporting turn from Olivia Colman, and an excellent script by Christopher Hampton and Florian Zeller (based on Zeller's play). It's a daring move to tell the story from the perspective of Hopkins' character as his mind increasingly deteriorates. A savvy one too, as the audience is forced to engage to truly understand what is real, who is who, and where precisely we are in our protagonist's gut-wrenching journey. This may be Hopkins best work, a late-career revelation that once again reminds us why he's one of our finest cinematic performers. Be warned.

I think it doesn't matter whether all events were 100% accurate, the simple fact that anything remotely like this happend is an utter disgrace, not worthy of any civilized nation.To me it one the best and most touching films I have seen in a long while. Tahar Rahim, whom I didn't know before, acted Oscar-worthy. I highly recommend.",

It's not a thriller and can be very disappointing when you go through the film at first. Whoever developed the trailer did not market it well and is very upsetting.\nBut if you sit back and experience it with no expectations, the film is actually very good.\nOur two main talented actors do a really good job of portraying these unique character and really give you a sense of who they are and what they are experiencing.\nAs of the time of this review, the film was just recently released and already is having mixed reviews. It's a story inspired by real situations told in a unique and thought-provoking way.\nWhich is why it really depends on your thoughts and views on the real world issues this is based on. It may come across as controversial in some ways but speaks some truth that isn't spoken enough about in the mainstream.\nThe ending was super good and doesn't leave you upset or unsatisfied like some films like to do.\nVery solid and deserves more credit.\nAlthough, whoever was in charge of marketing did not do a good job.",

The latter is unaware that a member of his own ranks is cooperating with the FBI to put a stop to him and the party.Judas and the Black Messiah is marked by outstanding performances. Lakeith Stanfield acts as the \"Judas\" in the film, i.e. traitor William O'Neal, who is infiltrated into the Black Panther group as a mole by FBI employee Roy Mitchell (Jesse Plemons) after attempted car theft. The two share a very believable and atypical chemistry that almost makes you suspect a friendship of sorts. The real person behind William O'Neal even said years later that he admired Mitchell. Stanfield is the real protagonist of the film. Large parts are taken up by Daniel Kaluuya as Fred Hampton, the \"Black Messiah\" beloved by many but just as much opposed by many.…",

A costume drama set in the past about exploring the past, where ancestors once explored the seas and pilots now fly in the skies.I'm less fond of the editing style that has audio of conversations overlapping silent moments, although the cinematography and production design stand out. Unfortunate for a Netflix release, it sometimes has the appearance of video lag, as though the the audio and picture had only become out of sync due to a poor internet connection. Otherwise, it doesn't seem much better than a confused imitation of Terrence Malick-esque ruminations, such as in, say, the recent WW2-era \"A Hidden Life\" (2019). I'm not sure what the filmmakers were trying to go for here, either--maybe that cinematic editing travels through time much like the burial…",

There was no other level to his performances, to me anyway they were always the same. I have never taken him seriously whatsoever, that is until now. \"Palmer\" is not just a good performance from Timberlake, it is a fantastic performance that I feel even deserves award consideration.

I appreciated the plot and call-out to alchemy, shamanism, and the forest as a deity who is desperate to send a message to humans. The cinematography was beautiful and captured what can be described as the \"brain\" of nature, with flashing synapses both ephemeral and eternal all at once, combining cyclical nature with the man-made flashes of photography. I loved the air of mystery and dread behind it, and the sound design certainly added to that. My critique is that the film felt a little drawn out; it could have been cut down. However, I saw this at Sundance, so it could have been a rough cut. With some tightening up, this visceral and psychedelic slow-burn horror shows quite a bit of promise.",

The whole film rests on the shoulders of MÃ©lanie Laurent's performance and she knocks it out of the park. I really sympathized with her and I wanted to see her make it out ok. The story was fascinating and lead to some twists and reveals that left my jaw on the floor. This is the best looking movie I have seen from Alexandre Aja so far and I really hope he keeps making movies like this. Let me put it this way, if a movie about a woman trapped in a space coffin for an hour and forty minutes can keep my attention, that's an achievement by itself. But \"Oxygen\" is so much more. The story, the script, the characters, the cinematography, the production design, the music. All of it, in my opinion, was mesmerizing. I highly recommend this movie to those who are looking to get a good fix of sci fi, and also those who are looking for a good mystery. Highly recommend!",

If it hadn't been found in summer 1939, that piece of land would have been used as a British Army tank training ground a few months later when war broke out.

Couldn't go wrong could it?\nHe comes across as lobotomised and the Suffolk accent is ridiculous. You can just imagine him looking in the mirror saying 'moooorrniiiin' over and over and crunching a carrot to get in character.\nThe performances all round are pretty bad and the Lady Penelope character acts about 150 years out of place.\nWorst of all is the film where almost nothing happens. Enthralling it isn't. Unless you enjoy watching Fiennes put on and take off wellies.\nIt would have been vastly improved by making the artefacts/treasure themselves as the main story and a nuanced and subtle Mr Basil Brown (it didn't help that this alliterative name continually evoked images of Basil Brush! Boom! Boom!) would still have been the central character and hogged the limelight but the iconic helmet etc. were nowhere to be seen.\nInstead we were left with a seemingly challenged central character and innocuous, irrelevant sidekicks (e.g. the wife of Fiennes) who again appeared to be one brick short.\nSlow torture it were and it's a shame as the subject matter could have been handled so much more adroitly.\nSpielberg or Ridley Scott would have insisted on imagined flashbacks to the burial with CGI. If Ray Winstone could do it in Beowulf!\nNever mind, thet tried in this but failed. Was all a bit too luvvy duvy art housy.",

Produced by Sam Raimi through its Ghost House Pictures banner, it stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Katie Aselton, William Sadler, Diogo Morgado, Cricket Brown, and Cary Elwes.Being one of the first major horror releases of 2021, The Unholy comes with a fairly interesting concept. After seeing the trailer I thought such a concept could lead to some thought provoking subject matter. But this does boil down to being a pretty textbook and bland movie. A spirit has influence over somebody, can our hero exorcise the demon?The acting is pretty good. Silly things happen like, a character walking into a room and finding a book that tells them the entire history of the demon, he does research in the archives and finds out some insignificant information that's supposed to add new depth to the story but doesn't. The monster looks quite awful and we…",

      "rating": 7,
      "review": "Probably not something you're going to re-watch but for me it was enjoyable.If you want something new this may not be the right choice, the general story is pretty standard:\nNewbie gets to the camp, meets more experienced mentor, experiences combat, handles it badly for a while, twist, he ends up on his own and somehow completes the mission.There are some cool parts to the story though. Most notably for me was the parallel between Leo and the standard combat drones.\nHe more or less wants the US to consider the consequences to their new weapon systems, that's why he does what he does. You can see it throughout the movie including the collateral damage from drone strikes, but more interesting is the fact that their combat robots have a tendency to fire first.\nSure their targets are armed and behaving in a threatening manner. But as demonstrated by Leo defusing the situation by the relief truck it doesn't have to end with a firefight.There's also an interesting parallel between them sending a drone pilot to experience combat in order to understand what happens when they fire a missile and the US learning the consequences of their weapons by one of those weapons turning against them. That's why Leo *MUST* be the one to do it.All in all a solid film. But it does suffer from some boneheaded mistakes including: the protagonist having over 56000 flight hours, that's 6 years 24/7, or 18 years full time. As such I would expect him to be in his late thirties at least, but I don't think the character was more than 25...\nThe Balkans being mentioned frequently despite the movie taking place in Ukraine some 600 miles and several countries away. And sure that one can be handwaved away, most of the time they are referring to a person, \"the terror of the Balkans\" and therefore not technically wrong. But throughout the movie it seems like they are referring to that title as if it has local significance...",

Lack of physical interaction / touching is also pretty noticable. I can commend the cast and crew for trying to get work done in the midst of a pandemic, but unfortunately the script itself is ultra lacking.The characters are one dimensional, and two of the main villains have a severe lack of motive and seem to both just have an inexplicable fetish for \"killing people.\" What an innovative concept for a baddie.

Not only the film is deepened with a wealth of filmed material that no one ever imagined existed, but it manages to redeem itself and to fight with tight fists the previous Justice League (2017) which was a total and a colossal flop in every aspect (not Snyder's fault, of course).

No worries: these main stars have never disappointed before and most certainly do not here! And the young actor, somehow, and unexpectedly - well, he's about as good as it gets, and his scenes with Fiennes are golden.We've all seen movies that we users basically like a lot, yet contradict the terrible scores from critics - \"Hillbilly Elegy \" anybody? - but when both user reviewers and critics are agreeing and are saying the same things, it's a pretty…",

      "review": "A group of reality show contestants and the show's producers find themselves fighting for their own survival against hideously deformed cannibal hillbillies who plan on making them all their dinner. Yes, this is the plot of Wrong Turn 2. However, believe it or not, the whole reality show sub-plot is actually better than it sounds, and thanks to the clever writers, it vanishes 30 minutes into the movie. Speaking of which, I have to say I was pretty satisfied with the end result since Wrong Turn 2 to my surprise turned out to be the best horror flick of 2007 I've seen. Think that's not saying much since 28 Weeks Later and Grindhouse were the only solid releases? Well, ahm, for a little direct-to-video flick that surpasses all expectations one might have - that's really, really good. Not saying that this is the best genre offering since Halloween, but as an enjoyable, pure fun and gory Slasher film, the flick just delivers. Have to say I was impressed with Mr Lynch's direction as well, since this was unbelievably his first ever motion picture project. The cast is also truly impressing for a DTV title; Rollins kicks ass as always (and sadly gets his ass kicked), the Palladino girl is even better than in Sidney Lumet's films, and once more Erica Leerhsen impresses even more and shows how very underrated she is, the woman should get more roles. The kills are effective and simple, the story ridiculous and enjoyable, and the flick is pure fun. Not brainy, not serious, just some great Slasher fun.Worth your money.",

The story was touching and the acting was very good but what brought it was Mr. Timberlake. I would have never have thought he could pull off a roll such as this.

I will never get the time I've spent on watching it back.There was literally no plot in the movie whatsoever, nothing made sense at all, as if the director didn't have a clue what he wanted to make in the first place. Acting was also pretty bad. The only good thing about it were gore effects that were top-notch.There was some sort of a virus having its origin in some sort of a fungus so I thought that there will be some kind of people turned in to some kind of fungal-infected monsters, this would make it far more interesting.Just avoid it if you can.

They take a vast scope to explore the story: a story about dreams and how this dreams affect their relationship.Pros and Cons\nWe are on the final chapter but the feel-good aura we felt since the first installment was still there as well as the comedic charm of the lead actress. 'To All The Boys: Always and Forever' served a countless praise worthy elements that makes the film more immersive and fascinating to watch. First, likable characters. Every character knew how to react on certain things without the need of being exaggerated and forceful just to make the scene interesting. Second, healthy relationship. LJ and PK's relationship isn't your cheesy type of couple who always going below the belt. They both knew how to build each other up.Aside from those remarks 'To All The Boys: Always and Forever' has a aesthetic and fascinating visuals. From the hand-drawn settings in Korea to the colorful Lara Jean's room makes the viewing experience more eye-catching.We've reached the final chapter but their love story that started from love letters to real life couple will remain memorable.

He has a loving relationship with his Cherry 2000 (Pamela Gidley). When it short-circuits, only the memory disk is salvaged. There are no Cherry 2000 replacements although there are expected stocks in the abandoned factory in the desolate Zone 7. Sam travels to Gloryhole Hotel and hires tracker E. Johnson (Melanie Griffith) to guide him to Zone 7. They battle Lester (Tim Thomerson), the leader of a strange cult.It's a campy B-movie with plenty of cult potential. It's wacky. It has strange takes on sex in the future. The wackiness never gets that funny. David Andrews isn't terribly charismatic. Melanie Griffith looks cool and gorgeous. She plays too cool at times and could have been a bigger performance. I don't like flying to Vegas. There are a few things that keep holding this movie back to being fun camp.",

It has a script so weak it should be classed as highly vulnerable, a plot that has more holes than my kitchen colander, and characters about as believable as a career politician.\nI did love the opening island scene where the girl actress playing the young Diana was superb, and apparently did all her non-cgi stunts. But then it went downhill faster than an illiterate skier passing a 'Warning - cliff ahead' sign.\nI won't go into detail over WW84s failings as I have a bus to catch...in a week, but I think I can reveal my favourite, jaw-dropping line from the film without it being a spoiler...'...

From a B-movie it's the main thing that keeps it from reaching 'masterpiece' B-Movie territory. There's many other things to nitpick, and with some better acting here, better dialogue there, and a more cohesive alignment with various things....could have launched it to the stratosphere.Point being.

      "review": "People saying that it was a cheap remake of the Goonies completely missed the point of the entire movie. It had a beautiful message of staying true to your roots, the importance of family, and respecting native cultures. Showing the real side of Hawai'i with local values, pidgin, 'olelo Hawai'i, customs and history was the best part of the movie in my opinion as someone born and raised on the islands. The Nightmarchers scene was my absolute favorite and was so touching and powerful. The local portrayal of Hawai'i is almost never scene in mainstream media so this was refreshing. Also, casting actual Pacific Islanders, Kamehameha grads, and people born and raised in Hawai'i was awesome. A great family-friendly movie.",

Director George Gallo has done some great movies in the past, such as Bad Boys, so this dud was kind of a surprise. In the film industry, it's called \"below-the-line work\" and is, surprisingly disappointing.THINGS I LIKED:\nWho doesn't love Academy Award winner Morgan Freeman? Honestly, I was kind of surprised he took on a role in such a mediocre movie. Unfortunately, he utters lame lines from his wheelchair like, \"Get outta there\", \"Don't pass out!\", and \"Turn right.\" He looks extremely bored during the entire movie. Weird, right? It reminded me of Bruce Willis, who has been seen in several movies recently that are just terrible. Are they both that hard up on cash these days?I've always liked Ruby Rose's chic, edgy, feminine look, so I wish she hadn't shaved off all of her hair. This is the first time…",

The plot is centered around overcoming tedium, disappointment in one's self, confronting some form of crisis that stops the protagonist dead in his or her tracks. It's the most basic recipe of a bildungsroman. The protagonist is forced to relive the same day untill he or she gets \"it\" right. Untill he or she find that wich he or she (respectively) is lacking, but desperately needs to move on and have a life. Sometimes \"it\" is something heroic, extraordinary, other times mundane. But always, and I mean always \"it\" involves a reinvention of one's self. Doing away with the old and letting something new arise. It's a lengthy, and oftentimes a painful process.\nThe reason I needed to expand on this is because this theme, which is quickly becoming a genre, is a basic form of telling a story about personal growth. It's as old as mankind. Recently, it is also being overused.\nMidlife crisis solved by personal connection, cowardice overcome by a sense of caring and taking on responsibility, jadedness supplanted by love, escaping cynicism by shouldering the weight of the world, respectively. Now, finally we get emotional pain eased by meaningful connection, dare I say love.\nI get it, it's true. It's a heartwarming tale, it's also lazy. Not on the part of the creators of this movie or any of the aformentioned, because these movies are good, rather on the part of the industry itself. Also due to the current references, this movie won't age well.\nWatch this movie, you'll like it I'm sure. And don't forget: meaningful personal connections and personal responsibility before anything else, lest we have a dozen more of these movies. Let's let the movie industry work for it's money; in the meantime if you need a reminder, just open the Bible, read buddhist texts or really any classic of western literature; or just watch these movies on a loop.",

While the performances of the leads were enjoyable, I found the movie's writing and direction so flawed as to be practically unwatchable.Gadot continues to embody WW laudably, if leaning at times toward overacting. Pine is effective as the \"fish out of water\" launched several decades into the future, even if some of his comedic moments with Gadot fall flat. Pascal plays a classically over-the-top 80's villain with enthusiasm - it seems he relishes every moment getting to play a bad guy. For me, Wiig gave the strongest performance of the first act - her comedic timing is given plenty of time to shine, and the audience has ample opportunity to empathize with her. Unfortunately, these four performances were not enough to dig this film out of the hole the writers created.Written with an over-inflated sense of…",

The first reactions were all positive, then critics became divided with it, and now the general public thinks it's just ok. Malcolm & Marie may not have captivated all audiences, but I for one found it to be a well-done film. The premise follows a filmmaker returning home with his girlfriend following a celebratory movie premiere as he awaits what's sure to be imminent critical and financial success. The evening suddenly takes a turn as revelations about their relationships begin to surface, testing the strength of their love. How I like to describe it is think of the worst argument from Marriage Story and stretch it out for almost two hours. Also add some Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? into the mix.

They throw around words like temporal anomaly and singularity without any further explanation to this infallible idea and believe we should understand it. The movie ends by wrapping up the most insignificant subplot. Almost every conversation our characters have are what they should do with infinite time, and during these conversations, they never stay still: they do something out of the ordinary and act like it's perfectly normal. Literally every side-character is generic and useless, as they serve the same metaphor. I was vastly uninterested in these characters to the point where when the movie Psycho'd itself and replaced the main character, I was tempted to stop watching. The actual titular map only shows up twice. There are about six montages in this film and they are all useless.The Map of Tiny Perfect Things is the reason I'm happy film is highly flammable.

Striving to make a living through casual jobs, Antony and Dasan dream of making it big someday, but they just don't make it to the shore. To the duo, clinging on to the 'lead' they had found in an interesting case is their only \"escape from reality\". The Director focuses on two issues here; cyber-crime and unemployment and brings about an equal balance in both core elements. While the subjects of cyber-crimes reveal how frightening and cunning certain Humans can be, the light that falls on Antony and Dasan and their lives make you empathetic and feel pity for them.

You get to your seat, you've got your snacks, and your anxiously waiting for it to start.And instead you get an Amy Schumer stand up special. That's what this \"Tom Clancy's\" \"Without Remorse\" is!Honestly, the 1993 adaptation of Super Mario Bros. Was a better adaptation of an original IP!Top notch actors phoning in performances. Bad cinematography. Bad writing. No realism. Bad sound mixing. Scenes so dark it makes the battle for winter fell seem bright. I could go on but why?The only redeeming quality to be found in this \"film\" is that they waited until Tom Clancy had passed before they made it so that he wouldn't have to see how much of a dumpster fire his (arguably best novel) master piece had become.",

In this telling of Billie Holiday's life the song Strange Fruit becomes central to the narrative, with government forces determined to stop her singing the mournful lament, afraid that it will ignite a civil rights movement. At one point she's even dragged from the stage after singing just the first few lines. The problem with all of this is it never happened. Federal Narcotics chief Harry Anslinger apparently claimed in letters that he \"asked\" holiday not to sing the song, but - even if that's true - that's about as far as it went. Holiday was never dragged off stage for singing the song; in fact, she sang the song in the very concert in which the film depicts this as happening. In any case, the civil rights movement was already a growing force long before Strange Fruit became a popular protest song. As for Billie, she was never especially political and was initially…",

After years of trials and errors, Aja apparently found his great breakthrough with 2019's Crawl. A disaster flick that, once again, people anticipated to be one of the worst movies of the year, and it ended up as one of the very best in the genre, at least in recent memory. Therefore, I was obviously not going to miss Oxygen, a French-speaking film that boasts a highly mysterious premise.Movies like this make spoiler-free reviews really challenging to put together.

Morgan Freeman obviously shot most of his scenes in one day (lol in one room).The editor was almost certainly on crack, the fades, the swipes and the cross fades were some of the most egregious editing choices I've ever seen.The opening scene that offers up some background info on one of the main characters last 6 minutes, it's interspersed with the opening credits and my god those six minutes are some of the longest six minutes you'll ever suffer!

      "review": "What goes on in the minds of Hollywood producers is beyond my comprehension. The story of John Clark has been ingrained throughout all of Tom Clancy's books, and Without Remorse was the best selling novel on his backstory. If you had such a good story, from such an acclaimed writer, why would you ever throw it all away just so you could \"re-imagine\" it ?? If you have no history, knowledge or love of Tom Clancy's books, then perhaps you'll have some small amount of interest in just another typical Hollywood low-budget film. But if you are a Tom Clancy fan, save yourself the heartache and agony of watching John Clark get re-imagined by some disingenuous Hollywood flunkie.",

Anyways while the first movie was going in a more serious direction, the characters in this one is comedic and not as serious as the first. From the jerkoff or a more annoying and less funny version of Stifler, to the douche bag boyfriend, to the nice girl, to the tough chick, to the tough guy, to the slut and etc. The characteristics of some of these characters are however sort of creative, with the lesbo, to the sensitive jock, to the bipolar vegan,…",

The acting is not particularly notable in Outside the Wire, but it worked. Anthony Mackie (Captain Leo) does it right ... a believable android and superhero type. Almost a cliche, but with some refreshing twists. Damson Idris (Harp) seemed a little flat, but it was part of his character ... and I found his character likable. You can identify with this guy when he is stricken by the horrors of war. He turns out to be a great Everyman, struggling with impossible choices, trying to do the right thing, forcing himself to go on when he wants to flee.

The first third provides a nostalgic return of many characters from the original which admittedly brought a few smiles and then goes downhill as soon as the truly atrocious Wesley Snipes is introduced. A real problem is that the \"coming to America\" part is so short lived. That's what made the original funny; the fish out of water tale. The story line involving a genXer going to Africa to wonder in a CGI backdrop world was neither interesting or funny. There would have been so many more options of a buddy movie storyline for Murphy and Hall to shine in but they went with a large portion of the film ignoring the multitude of talent from the original and having a romance between two characters nobody cares about. They could have just done a 90 minute movie based at the barber shop in Queens and it would have been more entertaining. They are lucky movie theaters are still closed as this would have been direct to streaming in any case.",

      "review": "This period piece based on true events depict the discovery and excavation find in Britain just prior to and during the beginning of World War II. The movie depicts an amateur excavator hired by a widow to investigate some mounds of dirt on her property. The set design is well conceived, the acting polished and maybe well understated. The relational interactions between the primary characters are fascinating as they do not fall into any of the contrived script contraptions to great effect. A subplot involving a young lady archeologist and her relationship with her husband bordered on being a uninvited distraction, but seems to blend acceptably well into the movie as a whole. This movie is both exciting and revealing, but in the wet, gray weather also exudes a rather somber sad tone throughout.",

When you realize that Without Remorse is supposed to be the foundation for Rainbow Six (which went on to revolutionize first-person shooters), it comes off as an even weaker attempt. Taylor Sheridan collaborates with video game writer Will Staples on a script that's best described as a hotchpotch of action film clichÃ©s. Bad Russian sub-bosses, a broken ex-soldier, monologues on American patriotism, zero character development, big nonsensical conspiracy theories, and a twist that's as predictable as it can get - you name it - this flick's got it!I usually dig the grit in Sheridan's scripts. Wind River and the Denis Villeneuve-directed Sicario are personal favourites. Without Remorse, however, has none of it. Michael B Jordan is a fine actor, but the shoddy material that he's given to work with does him no good. The set-pieces fail to excite, even with stuff blowing up every third minute. The final nail in the coffin is the main antagonist's…",

The camera work is rock solid, with genuine tense moments and powerful performances from the main characters.Watching the events unfold back then brings an interesting juxtaposition to recent events in America. Police brutality rooted in racism is still a reality. People in power with discriminatory beliefs still exists. It made me think about several realities that are still going on today. It made me think about how people in power can easily abuse their position. We like to think regulation is important to keep these people in check, but who's regulating the regulators? People in power can easily hire regulators to maintain the status quo.And what about crime rates? It disproportionately involves people of color because of centuries of racism that become rooted in the very culture of children born in lower socioeconomic groups. Violence…",

I was also quite moved by Liam's characters back story and how it impacted his decision to help the young boy to safety. Their scenes together were quite touching. The ending also surprised me as it gave a few seconds of humanity to someone whom I would never suspect deserved it. Unfortunately we can all become victims of situations that are beyond our control.

Waking up trapped in a cryogenic unit, the main character had to figure out who she was before oxygen ran out.The first 2/3rd of this movie was pretty typical of a claustrophobic thriller. It built up certain things before the twist came.And there wasn't only one twist. The last third act became a showdown of twists with each one coming after another as the main character figured out what was going on. This was where tension became high, and when I enjoyed the movie the most.There were fear, panic, and confusion about what was real and not. And Mélanie Laurent played the role very well and delivered all the emotion.The visuals were also stunning. The camera angles on the main character throughout the movie were creative. There were also other visuals, but I can't talk about them without spoilers.Overall, an entertaining last third act made up for the typical buildup. I wished the ending…",

Sorry does not seem real. Adding a female special forces combat officer strectched it even more.So then we get to Tom Clancy's \"Without Remorse\" the only thing the novel and this movie share is the name. I can look padt the obvious race of the main charscter, but somehow he turned white in earlier (later) storylines. The plot was brought up to date instead of Kelly being a Vietnam operator., ok, maybe I can look past that, but the antagonist was totally changed from street drug gang to Russian special forces. We have now come full circle ahain were its ok to portray Russians as the bad guys again. The jail brawl was terrible.

How can someone in a constant time-loop not figure out what someone wants when nothing else works? Also, if one has been in a time-loop a thousand or more times, knows almost every little thing that will happen, how difficult is it to find a dog? It's the little things that stick out to people in time-loop films.The cliché of doing a topic over and over again is us inevitably in a time-loop. What I think makes a great love story to watch is the one viewing it becomes enamored with one or both of the characters who is in the love story. Mark (Kyle Allen) is the one we start off with. We see through his daily routine that he's been in the loop for quite awhile, so in essence: we learn nothing about him except he has a father in his life, a mother that works, apparently, a lot, a younger sister who's on the soccer team, and a best friend who he talks to but...they're all inconsequential to each…",

      "review": "Sorry to go against the grain of all the rave reviews here, but I thought that although The Dig was beautifully, produced and photographed, it was dull, boring and tedious. It could easily have been edited down to an hour. The movie was saved by the impeccable performance of Ralf Fiennes as Basil Brown, with a pretty credible Suffolk accent.\nSPOILER ALER\nThe writer clearly needed to pad out what, after all, is a very simple story with the entirely irrelevant triangular love saga of the frigid relationship between Stuart and Peggy Piggot, and the fictional cardboard-cutout character of dashing young Rory Lomax. The Piggots had apparently just come off their honeymoon, but clearly had no interest in each other and Peggy eventually fell for Rory. Earlier in the movie, Rory, who was about to join the RAF, had bravely dived into a river to attempt to rescue the pilot of a Spitfire that had crashed into it. Rory appeared to hold his breath for several minutes while extracting the pilot's body. This whole side story was irrelevant, ill-fitting and distracting from the main plot.\nHaving praised Ralph Fiennes, I cannot say the same for Carey Mulligan as my instant reaction on first seeing her on screen was \"Oh there is a young actress trying to portray a character much older than herself\".\nBeing new to Netflix, this is the first of their home-grown movies I have watched. I was disappointed at how they could spend so much time and effort to make a movie that looked so good, but in its structure and narrative was so disappointing.",

Yes, he was solid in the film Alpha Dog, but I believe that being directed by David Fincher really broadened his horizons. Starring in films like Friends with Benefits, Trouble with the Curve, or even In Time, he has proven that there's more to him than meets the eye in terms of acting. Palmer only furthered those thoughts for me. While Timberlake never seems to choose projects that will win him awards, he's always very, very solid in whichever role he does take. Palmer has many similar tropes to movies you've seen before, but here's why the subject matter, along with a great central performance by Timberlake, warrants a viewing.After serving time for over a decade, Eddie Palmer (Justin Timberlake) returns home to live with his grandmother, only to see that a troubled family lives next door.

It was a quasi ripoff of Dean Koontz's Intensity, one of the most thrilling books that I had read till that time. I was hooked on to Aja's work and have followed him closely over the last 15 years.He has churned out some low brow stuff such as Piranha but I have been blown away by The Hills have eyes, Crawl and now Oxygen.There are quite a few twists in this, which I didn't foresee and which changed the whole narrative. Aja's direction and Laurent's acting easily elevate this to the top echelon of locked - room thrillers.Really loved it. Watched it in It's original language (French).",

During the film the couple toxically argue over and over, make up, tease the audience with a sex scene and Marie (Zendaya) exhaustingly and frustratingly starts arguing with Malcolm again. It's a cycle that becomes more monotonous every time it begins. Within half an hour it becomes conspicuous that this is going to be the entire narrative. Despite this, cinematically it is beautiful and unique in appearance and has that quality of a \"film having a heart\", to quote Malcolm. An excellent film for filmmakers; but a tedious one for everybody else.",

You hope that these folks would bond at some point, but they never really do. When an attempt to create some bonds, it just falls flat and is not very genuine.The second big problem is the storyline splits off in several incomprehensible arcs which repeatedly breaks the flow of the story.

I also thought that the film found very clever ways to show of the traps and situations that our characters are in. Chris Rock was very entertaining to watch in the main role, I didn't think I would enjoy seeing him as a detective but he really surprised me.The Mixed- Now Samuel L Jackson's character is very important to the film and script and he is connected to everything, however he doesn't have lots of screen time. If you are expecting lots from him, you'll probably be disappointed.The Bad- Straightaway we have seen these types of characters and films before, the rogue detective and charismatic villain has all been done before. Finally I thought the final twist was fairly predictable. There was one scene where the film was basically telling you what the final twist was going to be and that sort of cheapened the moment for me.Overall I'm going to give Spiral: From The Book Of Saw a 7/10.",

      "review": "It's unfortunate because some of my absolute favorite people in the industry worked on this film; Natasha Lyonne, Salaam Remi, Leslie Jordan. This movie was a hard watch, not because of the content but because it managed to make something that was interesting in real life, uninteresting. Another case of a story being brought to the big screen by the wrong hands. The film moves all over the place, it can't make up it's mind on what story it's trying to tell. We start off by seeing Billie Holiday (Andra Day) starting an interview with a gossipy southern radio host played by Leslie Jordan. I figured that would be the format the film would continue on with; everything she tells the interviewer gets shown on the screen as the film goes along. Needless to say, that's not what happened. The interview comes back here and there but it's not going in the order of what's happening.A lot of the scenes are tailored to show Andra Day's talents, the story gets lost in their focus to show her acting…",

They make superb movies that exist contrary to the stereotypical efforts coming out of Hollywood recently & as such are a breath of fresh air. Space Sweepers, however, does not deserve the same accolades. To begin with, I was put off by erratic behaviour from the characters as they displayed cartoon-like, exaggerated responses, behaved irrationally at every turn & would suddenly launch into fits of violence for no apparent reason. Really. It was like a bad martial arts film. The dialogue was far too rapid & to be honest I just couldn't keep up with the subtitles. The action sequences were choppy & it was difficult to follow exactly what was supposed to be going on. To make things worse the story was not sufficiently engaging & after about half an hour I gave up. On the plus side though, the special effects are stunning,",

The first scenes were just so stupid and pointless.

I'm going to get to the excellent points about what makes this sequel fun to watch.The director actually gives us a decent story which we can watch and work out. He also gives us enough creepy scenes for where we can be creeped out sometimes.The director gave us some good kills and I actually enjoyed all of these kills and none of them were crappy at all. The actions sequences and chases sequences were also executed well and that made the film bump up to it's right potential.The one little problem I had though was the cannibals who didn't look as effective or as real as the ones in the first film.

The themes on humanity at it's worst self is emphasized throughout the film but the execution is too clumsy for it to make much of an emotional impact. It just goes to show that we don't need alien intruders, crashing asteroids, or severe malfunctions in the spaceship to threaten the mission when the worst of human nature can cause a much bigger problem.We also witness the kindness of compassionate and sympathetic characters like Sela (Lily-Rose Depp) that balances out the movie's equilibrium to an extent.Think it has more to do with the outlook on humanity's worst self more than the spectacle of showing breathtaking views of space and distant exoplanets.

I would have been fine with something a little lame but with that certain Cage flair.Instead, I got something surprisingly good. The cinematography was balanced, with little bits of surreal and fun angles, but never so much to become distracting. Good color scheme and lighting, and the creature design really captured that slightly terrifying look of way-back-when Chuck E Cheese.I enjoyed how the script was full of tropes, but the actors carried it well, and everything came across well. Almost like everyone was having fun, wanted the audience to enjoy themselves, but they took it just serious enough to deliver good performances.The whole movie is right on that edge of camp and parody, without necessarily being played…",

He doesn't know whether or not to make a film on the legendary singer and her life and struggles or a commentary on the drug war and it shows and over shadows the piece. What doesn't help matters is the cinematography of the film which looks like into a TV movie and not a theatrical release which is sad, because it has a great cast to make this work.

Firstly the jokes are stretched out way beyond their humour and the chemistry is totally missing between Melissa and Octavia's characters. It's as if she signed up to the film, before reading the script ('cause it had Melissa in it of course, why wouldn't you!?) and later regretted the decision, but it was too late to say no.This could have been so much better, the acting, jokes, direction and so on. The only person (character) who I felt close to genuine was the actress playing the daughter of Octavia's character. She did a fine job in duff circumstances.Only watch if you have nothing better to do. Melissa, you are so much better than this!",

I was so excited and went in with high expectations hoping for the best and to be honest, I was surprised despite a few small things I picked up. I know the reviews have been hit and miss so far but this one really did it for me. The costumes were amazing, a real stand out, along with the sets and the music as well (all definitely Oscar worthy). The acting was spectacular, particularly from Thompson who made a fabulously hideous monster out of the Baroness. Stone's portrayal of the famous Cruella De Vil was brilliantly exhibited, and many of her scenes (particularly the fountain scene near the end) were my favourites in the film. However, who things in particular stood out for me. Firstly, I believed this film was supposed to be a prequel to Glenn Close's portrayal of the classic villain. However, many things did not match up between the two films. The…",

Yes, real people don't talk as smoothly but isn't that the point? What if you could be a fly on the wall during a poetic argument between two beautiful people in their beautiful home?

      "review": "I'll admit, I went in expecting a terrible script that some drunk Netflix executive green lit, banking solely on McCarthy's comedic fame to get viewers. The first ten or so minutes seemed to prove me wrong: the child McCarthy and Spencer's friendship was cute, and I even give the writers props for avoiding the whole \"bully turned into smart kid's friend\" trope. Then they quickly age up the characters (which, okay, I didn't sign up for a teenage story anyway) and they become estranged (fine, I've fought over much stupider stuff with my friends), all with very little humour, and none of it stupid. Was the film targeted wrong? Is this a semi serious superhero movie, and not a comedy with a superhero veneer?When McCarthy herself finally shows up, the film initially keeps the half serious tone, and paints a fairly depressing picture of a world where supervillains (albeit petty ones) exist without superheroes to fight them. They kept showing small acts of kindness on McCarthy's part, which all supported the idea she would make a great hero (a-la Steve Rogers being a hero even without his powers). I even appreciated McCarthy's nonsensical dialogue with Kevin Dunn's character, taking for granted that it wasn't supposed to be \"ha ha\" funny, and sounded like rambling in universe as well.Maybe I shouldn't have. Maybe that was supposed to be a laugh out loud bit, that simple did not land. Because from the reunion onwards, the film decides it clearly does not care about the tone it was setting, and becomes just another terrible script that some drunk Netflix executive green lit, banking solely on McCarthy's comedic fame. It just took some time to pretend it wasn't.What follows is just another superhero spoof, with a little heart here and there (I'll admit McCarthy was sweet as Taylor Mosby's sort of aunt), but otherwise nothing to say. It feels more like a collection of unrelated SNL skits, held together by spit and the pure comedic power of raw chicken eating. The villains are goofy, and not in a good way, the plot is as predictable as they come, the \"twists\" are as predictable as the plot, and overall it looks like Ben Falcone wrote half a script and then didn't bother to re-read it.Which is a shame, because the first ten minutes felt like this could be a solid superhero spoof, if maybe not a serious superhero movie. In the end, I got what I initially expected, but I still managed to be disappointed.",

The gore in this movie is superb if your into that stuff. You have an arrow through to heads and through the eye of the other. An axe going straight down he middle of a cute blonde and her intestines left on the ground. A scene with a girl face down in a stream being slashed behind by a hillbilly until her back bone is visible. And on and on and on, a great mix of disgusting gore. Although, I must admit I enjoyed the first wrong turn more than this, purely because it was more suspenseful and less gory, but this one I think they made especial attention to the gore o meter.

My opinion has changed greatly such that I shall go seek out other Frank Grillo movies.As the main guy Boss Level, he delivered an outstanding performance. His blasé deadpan attitude was very funny - after all he is a guy who was just over it, starting each day, dying, rinse and repeat,There are some real parallels with Groundhog Day on the journey he takes - the ups and down, and how he games it to his advantage.Mel Gibson was ok, a typical Action Move Antagonist - some of the other quite unique characters maybe be somewhat clichéd,…",

This is one of those films that I truly wanted to LOVE.I'll list my PROS & CONS, to include the positives and negatives that I may have overlooked in a more general review.\nCONS:Not very original storyline, too much copied from David Fincher's \"Sev7en\", or Denzel's \"Training Day\" (both of which included the \"retiring-cop-teaching-new-rookie-the-ropes\" theme). It was a challenge to convert my mindset to the PRE-smart phone technology of the early '90's, which made the instant communication factor non-existent. Of course that is no one's fault, just frustrating, lol. I guess if the story took place currently, it would have been a completely different plot.Too much jumpy editing from scene to scene.Too much focus on Sparma being the sole killer, not including any other tentative perps.Flashback overkill to inform the viewer how deeply Denzel's unsolved murders…",

This film may not be as serious or as dark as the original film but it still works very well because like the original you have some likable characters and a great location and some good cinematography and you also get some suspenseful scenes that work very well. now granted not all of the characters are likable you do get your cliché characters like the rude girl and the cheating boyfriend type,but most of the characters were likable.I liked Hennry Rollins in the film i thought he was a Badass and he was fun to watch,and if people are a fan of the guy then i would definitely recommend you to watch this film because Hennry Rollins kicks a lot of ass in this film and beats up a lot of The hillbillies. What i also liked about this film was that it was unpredictable because you didn't know who would live and who would die and that made the film different and more exciting…",

I wanted to see him getting crazy and showing emotions like the other 2 movies I mentioned, and instead we got a non-speaking dull and boring protagonist.Ok, at first it was charming to see him not utter a single word, but later in the moive I was shouting at the monitor: \"TALK DAMN IT\"!. Very poor execution of a non-speaking protagonist!Also, I really hoped he had some background for example his wife and kid(s) were killed but he somehow survived and returned to avenge their deaths, or maybe he was a kid that witnessed some killings taking place and had so much trauma he couldn't speak after it - NOT! Not a single scene where ANY of his behavior is explained. The moments when he's so much sticking to his schedule and letting the kids die really angered me too.

It's very much a run of the mill BBC pot boiler of the kind that Miramax trotted out twice a month in the early '90s, with very little to get you excited. The creatives seemed to have picked that up halfway through the script, so they added a completely inconsequential love triangle amongst the co-stars and saddled poor Lily James with some terrible situations and silly dialogue. Ben Chaplin and Lily James picking out sleeping arrangements sent me to the fridge for sustenance to bare me through the last 45 minutes. The stakes of the find at the center of the \"action\" are that Anglo Saxon civilization had attained cultural heights in Ipswich much earlier than previously known. That seems to be totally irrelevant to the protagonists. Moments of consequence, generally when Carey's characters take on the cultural establishment, mostly happen off screen. (Ran out of money? Ended up on the cutting room floor?) If the characters, the writers and the director don't care about the stakes, why should I?",

The following failed heist is equally juvenile - taking place in a mall and is just plain silly. It's far from the grittier atmosphere that DC has been so good at recently.The interpretation of 80's culture is completely distracting and strips away any gravitas.

      "review": "The 2000s were a strange decade for Horror, and while there was no shortage of quality outings, standouts included increasingly preposterous sagas like Saw and Paranormal Activity. The little home-grown movies that could each grew into those Horror parodies you see in children's cartoons. The most unlikely of superstars, Chris Rock, has now collaborated with Lionsgate and director Darren Lynn Bousman to jumpstart Saw with a revival that has some back to basics thrown in. 'Spiral' is trying to be for this franchise like 'New Nightmare' was for A Nightmare on Elm Street in the 90s- and it halfway succeeds. It may just be on par with the original installment in terms of creativity and thematic links to David Fincher's 'Seven', and there's certainly no contest between this and the Red Bull fueled froth that came in between- but it's also ham-fisted to a fault.It should be no surprise nowadays when a comedic actor or creator reinvents themselves with Horror or Drama (Jordan Peele, Craig Mazin with 'Chernobyl'), so Rock delivers as Det. Zeke Banks with sincerity. With his manifesto from years back comes a slew of humor that appeals to a more diverse audience. Samuel L. Jackson as Zeke's father/retired police chief is entertaining and scene-chewing as always. He's however not in this film as much as you might be led to believe, giving more room for Rock to steal the show.Its injections of comedic relief are cringey at times, but certainly a cut above the worst moments in 'It: Chapter Two' and some of the Marvel installments. The direction and production values are also at times noteworthy; with the sepia-toned, heat wave induced big city and its urban atmosphere help breathe new life.However the direction also comes a good amount of the typical Saw schtick- high-pitched jump scares and gimmicky editing. Many trailers aren't as bad as a number of cinephiles make them out to be, but here's an exception. The first trailer show a level of nuance in maneuvering suspense much better than the final product: because much of the dialogue is clunky, shouty and almost incapable of understatement- save for the final twist that pays off many of the themes and imagery set up throughout. They also mirror our more socially conscious country, and the roles of good and bad cops (guess what the dead pigs that Jigsaw used to use is brought back as symbolism for). It's a very 2020 Horror film and probably not as clever as it could be, but the final twist and elements in between may just as well be the next best thing for this dinosaur franchise.Grade- 2.5 out of 4 stars.",

Director Simon Stone also impressively crafts phenomenally edited sequences (thank you Jon Harris) to capitalise off of these impactful moments of dramatic tension, exacerbating the meticulously placed silences throughout - where the unspoken words deafen audiences with their intentional presence - until the quality of the material present in the script is elevated even further as a result. Commendation is therefore owed to the outstanding sound designers - who really bring their A game here - & additionally, to cinematographer Mike Eley, who genuinely astonishes with his gorgeous camera work / uses of natural light, gently immersing audiences in to the story with handheld shots that feel warm, grounded & hopeful - akin to Terrence Malick's 1978 classic, \"Days of Heaven\".Can't recommend it highly enough.

My grandpa who grew up in North Hollywood thought this movie was phenomenal he could even tell where of the scenes where located. He grew up in noho skating and he loved to see that people were still representing the skate culture in North Hollywood. Now my 13 year old self thought this movie was amazing Ryder and Angus will be big names in this industry I'm telling you! The fact that you showed the true feelings taht parents have with skate culture was phenomenal.

It is elusive and difficult to penetrate despite its rather straightforward set up of a couple, debating amongst themselves and each other on if their relationship is truly fruitful or sustainable, almost like a stage play in its approach.It is a film that has been labeled as 'pretentious,' which is certainly understandable, some of its dialogues often go on and on, talking about topics in a way that some might find to feel wanting or desperate to sound profound or meaningful. But I never felt the condescension and self importance of The Matrix or the more egregious self-aggrandizement that Lars von Trier is capable of, attempting to convince everyone how 'deep' and meaningful he is, Malcolm & Marie felt more…",

Few people are complaining about the CGI but just ignore them, they're spoiled from watching movies with $200+ million budget. I could only imagine what Koreans could do with that kind of money spent. And please don't make comparison to the Expanse, Firefly, or anything else because it's completely different. Only similarities are that it's in the future and outer space. If you think this is bad, watch the $250 million budget John Carter. A huge letdown! There are others I won't mention.For Korea's first space sci-fi movie I was truly pleasantly surprised how good it was and loved that there were international cast as well.",

Even as a buddy super hero story, the concept is new and should've been a lot of fun. Instead the jokes are flat, the story is too forced to feel like you care about the characters, and ultimately just not entertaining.A few moments scattered in the film do come together, but they're few and far between.

      "rating": 9,
      "review": "This is the final movie in to all the boys trilogy. Lara Jean and Peter are in their senior year, planning for college while navigating their relationship.What I liked-\n1. Talks about real teenage relationship issues.\n2. Effects of absent parental relationships.\n3. Consent.\n4. Candy-Pastel Colour pallet.What I didn't like\n1. It's a bit slowThe best part about TATB apart from great acting and song selections is its dedication to talk about teenage issues in relationships. It's a character study of 2 teenagers LJ and Peter who fear that they'll never find true love because their parents either unintentionally, in case of LJ or intentionally, in case of Peter, left them when they were young. That lack of love disrupts their belief and expression of love.In this movie we see lots of relationships- LJ's dad finding love after years of loneliness, The sister bond among the song girls is at its tender peak, Kitty has a Korean boyfriend, Peter reconciles with his father, and last but not the least LJ and Peter took the courage to love each other despite the odds that they face- 3000 miles apart.In 1st and the 2nd movie (the drowned one in my opinion) we saw LJ dealing with her fears- stable love, insecurity because of comparison, people from the past, etc and Peter with his lack of open communication. In the 3rd-\n1. LJ comes out of her hesitancy and fully takes agency over her life- accepts stable love, visits Korea, explores NYC, speaks her mind etc, which were big character developments.\n2. In a vulnerable moment LJ says \"I choose you\"- admirable. It shows they are in for the long haul.\n3. They are emotionally mature to talk about sex. (such a relief from other dumb rom-com)\n4. Peter finally overcomes his fear that \"no one chooses him\", accepts LJ's dreams and also communicates his feelings. We see his sensitivity, a character development.They are finally ready to take care of themselves and their relationship. To all the boys is that one series which took me out of the rom-com rut. Thank you guys for creating this simple beautiful story. A well-deserved farewell.",

      "review": "\"Tough good guy seeks revenge after wife and child are murdered\" is a stock movie plot that's probably been done way too many times, but there are ways to make it interesting. This film doesn't. It just delivers a cookie-cutter revenge plot, mixes in a few dozen more well-worn tropes, and plods its way to the end.The big reveal and the twist ending were both predictable from early on and significant parts of the plot didn't make sense. The story itself felt disjointed, lurching from one set-piece action scene to another. It felt very much as if the writers had given up and were just phoning it in.The target audience is clearly people who like guns and soldiers way too much, but the filmmakers then made the baffling decision to throw in a Black female Navy SEAL commander, infuriating and alienating the very demographic that the movie was made for. The character, incidentally, is perhaps the only one in the film who has any kind of screen presence. She's not believable as a military bad-ass, but she is at least interesting to watch, not something that can be said for any other character in the film.The same apathy that infected the writers seems to have spread to most of the actors. Even the often-excellent Guy Pearce looks like a man who's mostly thinking about his paycheck. Jodie Turner-Smith does a capable job with few words and subtle gestures, but she's probably in the wrong movie. Michael B. Jordan just seems numbed, not so much by personal tragedy as by dull writing. He too deserves a better movie: here he delivers a by-the-numbers performance for a by-the-number script.",

The film also gives us a great balance of story, character, and action. Why does the story work so well? Because like all great storytellers, they focus on the story and the characters.George Lucas once stated, \"a film with special effects and no story is a pretty boring thing.\" Funny how he would actually end up going against his own proverb, and it is also true of what has happened with much of western filmmaking, as stated above.The film also has a lot of heart, which will make the viewer all the more appreciative that it isn't just an action movie.

Problem is this movie isn't even that visually interesting. The credit sequence is the highlight of the movie!! What's the point of having a movie in Vegas if you do nothing with your setting and reduce it to crumbling soft focus background details. Oh but there is one scene with slot machines!! Literally a one minute scene when they are in a casino the rest they are in dark corridors or piles of rubble. Are we supposed to believe that zombies completely eradicated Vegas and reduced it to rubble. Literally looked like a meteor hit Vegas.My biggest problem are with the characters. There are way too many it reminded me a lot of suicide squad the way they introduced them in this montage. They literally hire one of the team members because he made a YouTube video shooting zombies.. like really.. aren't there some more soldiers you know? But seriously who cares who makes it out. And you made a 2.5 hour movie with a story that could have been told in 70min and couldn't figure out how to make us care about any of the characters.I could go on and on. I used to love zombie movies (original Dawn one of my favorite movies.. Zack remake was..) but they have been reduced to nothing more that pointless monster movies that are a shell of what they once were with absolutely nothing to say other than here's some gore!

Sucker Punch and Justice League et al delivered the goods but there were no money shots here, just some goofy CGI and ho-hum action sequences, all dimly lit and shot with a zoom lens, cramping the scenes and blurring out the background, i.e. The zombie horde (the money shots).It's hard to believe this is the same director who did the great 2004 Dawn of the Dead remake. If only James Gunn had done the script for this one too! The writing is the real nail in the coffin here, with a plot so implausible that even an 8 year old would want to poke holes in it.The only thing truly dead here is any hope for the upcoming franchise, and also my behind from sitting through this 2 1/2 bore.",

      "review": "\"OXYGEN\" directed by Alexandre Aja and written by Christie Leblanc. Available on Netflix.When a woman wakes up in a cryogenic chamber with no memory, she'll struggle to escape as the oxygen in her capsule begins to become critical. Her only means of communication is an onboard computer named MILO with which she must discover who she is, why she is there, and how to remedy her nightmare before time runs out.The French director leaves the piranhas (Piranha 3D) and killer crocodiles (Crawl), to finally sign a high-concept thriller shot in claustrophobic atmosphere with a wonderful Melanie Laurent. The generous and involved French actress takes up the challenge with amazing interpretation. With her face and voice as her only means of expression, Laurent runs the gamut of emotions, from fear to anger to grief. She simply gives one of the best performances in an exercise where she was not particularly expected.While claustrophobes will start to feel dizzy, the narrative finally gets out of this \"jail\" and allows us to escape and discover her memories at the same time as the heroine does. The flashbacks in the hospitals, with masked patients and doctors, make the tension rise even more strongly on these particular days of COVID.Nevertheless, the film don't fall into weird conspiracy and remains on track avoiding even any resemblance with the thriller 'Buried' except for their concept of confinement. The script never ceases to surprise with its rich concept of thematic and narrative twists and turns, and feeds the curiosity of the viewer who constantly wonders about the resolution.Alexandre Aja directs a thriller in a confined environment of a very different kind, but very effective. With current themes of isolation, loss and fear of an uncertain future, \"Oxygen\" has never lived up to its name. Thanks to solid direction in an incredibly confined space and the phenomenal work of Melanie Laurent, the film becomes a welcome breath of fresh air in today's world.",

Human relationships have broken down so much that every interaction has to be arranged by lawyers and hooking up at a bar involves a lengthy legal contract. It's no wonder then that our protagonist Sam prefers to stay at home with his sexbot, a vintage Cherry 2000 model who is essentially a traditional subservient housewife. Unfortunately, during a frothy romp in front of the dishwasher his Cherry malfunctions, leaving him no alternative but to hire a guide to take him to the dangerous zone to find a replacement model at the robot junkyard. This guide turns out to be a spunky, independent woman (played by Melanie Griffith!) and...you can probably guess the rest but that doesn't mean it isn't fun getting there. While it's true that several plot points wouldn't hold up under close scrutiny this is a B movie so that sort of adds to the charm. No real complaints here and it was interesting seeing Griffith in that role.",

Lightyears better than the first movie, Wrong Turn 2 is legions ahead of most movie sequels and is not just intelligent, but nasty, strange, funny, and wholly unpredictable. The whole movie is one non-stop thrill ride, and the ending is simply perfect.So does the movie tie in well with the original? Yes, it definitely does! Besides a few inconsistencies with the two surviving characters from the first film, this sequel brings back two of the cannibals and introduces a vast family of creepy disgusting inbreeding freakshows.And let's talk about scares and gross-out factor. Was this movie incredibly disturbing? You bet your sweet ass it was! The acting was not just amazing for direct-to-video fare, but the directing and cinematography are stunning. For once, we have a highly original plot slightly in the vein of Halloween: Resurrection, but…",

Sure, I've played his video games, and have even watched a few of the Jack Ryan films, but other than that, you couldn't get me to spew any trivia about him or his works if my life depended on it. So, as embarrassing as this is to admit, when I saw the promo for \"Without Remorse,\" I didn't even know it was based on a real book - I thought they were simply using Tom Clancy's name as a marketing ploy to get viewers. Regardless, this is all just a roundabout way to get you to realize that, when it comes to my review on this film, you can rest assured that I had no preconceived notions when sitting down to watch this, and nothing to base it off of; all I wanted was an entertaining action movie.\"Without Remorse\" is not an entertaining action movie.

Harrison Ford sick with a cold on the set of Raiders of the Lost Ark? Produces one of the most hilarious/endearing scenes of the entire film. In that same vein, \"Malcolm & Marie\" was created in the midst of a pandemic, thus necessitating only two leads, a stripped-down crew/location, and a rushed process. No time to make everything perfect or obsess over the small details. What results through this uncharacteristic process is an equally uncharacteristic cinematic experience.For a very basic overview, \"Malcolm and Marie\" tells the story of the titular lead characters coming home from Malcolm's (John David Washington) film premiere. While he's bouncing off the walls with energy, wife Marie (Zendaya) seems a bit perturbed. Viewers quickly come to realize that Malcolm forgot to thank Marie in a speech, and that rift…",

Here it's a bit like the Railway Children - exciting incidents at intervals. Realising that archeology might seem dull, it was decided there should be a couple of dramatic accidents and a love affair, neatly spaced through the running time. If only they could really have devoted themselves to transmitting the fascination of the archeology involved. It would have been a big challenge, but great if it had come off. (By the way, it's weird that we are not properly shown the treasure - not even in the end credits.) Instead we have a hefty dose of the dreamy \"last summer before war\" trope, admittedly with the odd downpour. I'm getting round to saying it's a bit boring. The actors: Carey Mulligan is too young, but otherwise wonderful (as is the boy playing her son). Ralph Fiennes is excellent. Lily James is wearing oversized modern designer glasses, lest we forget that she's a beautiful young actress of the 21st century. Johnny Flynn is too old, but gets away with it and really inhabits the period, especially in his manner of speech.",

Series veteran Darren Lynn Bousman (Saw 2, 3, 4) directs this film and was a perfect choice to come back and take the helm again. Jigsaw (2017) writers Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg return to write. Combining Darren with the writers was a great choice. They keep elements that made the films iconic and changed it up. New puppet, voice, etc. With all these new changes and seeing how it all played out, I'm really excited to see where this all leads next. All in all I'd say this was worth the wait. Go ahead and give it a watch as soon as you can!",

It's easy to get carried away with criticism, when watching a low-budget movie, especially Sci-Fi, when your expectations have been raised with the likes of (Insert your favorite high-budget Sci-Fi movie).The story (and acting) did all the heavy lifting. This movie does a great job in conveying the claustrophobic experience Melanie's character has to go through, with the countdown to death keeping the suspense. Plot keeps you guessing with each twist, and makes the audience imagine what they would go through in each step. Granted, some decisions can seem far-fetched, irratic, but given the conditions and the origins of the main character, it should be enough to forgive its flaws.This movie gave me \"Moon (2009)\" vibes, eliciting a virtual simulation of an emotional ride I would have, if I was in the protagonist shoes (pod).",

The movie opens with the main character waking up inside a cryogenic pod with no recollection of who she is or how she ended up there. Her only ally is the AI, MILO, manning the chamber.The first act is mainly Liz (the MC) freaking out, trying to remember who she is and how she got into this predicament. The second act is filled with impending gloom as she realises that she's quickly expanding her oxygen supplies yet has no means of escape. These were the most thrilling and engaging aspects of the movie because we experienced the frustration, claustrophobia and fear along with Liz. The cinematography does a great job of emphasising this claustrophobic environment as well as capturing the futuristic pod.The let down is in the third act for me, I thought it fell a little flat from what was promised. Regardless, it kept me on my toes the entire time.",

Amazon Studio's latest venture into Tom Clancy's universe turned out to be a colossal disappointment! Atrocious Writing, Mediocre Performances, and Conspicuous Enfeeblement in terms of presenting its Action made the entire experience bitterer!Right from its introductory sequence; I realized, something amiss. In spite of the fact that it immediately gets underway with Gunfight & Explosions, the particular way in which they handle all of it created an impression of nonchalance!Excluding some gratifying moments that clearly demonstrate Cinematographic flair; in other parts, it's got its own set of problems! Such as the Score; frequently masking pivotal parts of every other conversation. Furthermore, Lighting in certain scenes appears to be too dim. Likewise, the Screenplay inflicted with apathy often enough! Translating into an uninspiring array of events.Speaking of Performances, I find them to be average at best. Michael B. Jordan is a known performer and we are all aware of his capabilities as an actor. With such shoddy script in hand; there was nothing he could do. From my point of view, the character of John Kelly/Clark deserved greater representativity!All things considered; personally this hasn't been a pleasant viewing, not a bit! Efforts had been made to do things differently but they failed to bring into play two principal constituents of any Action Flick; i.e. Thrill and Vehemence!",

True, the characters were recovering from the death of a child, but still, you have to give the audience something to root for, some personality trait that makes you want this family to survive. Everything is shot in monotones. Rooms are dark, somber. People mope. And it rains. I've given two stars for the scenery, despite the rain. Shot in Vancouver, apparently, I got the impression the director, depressed himself, said to his camera crew, 'For God's sake, get some shots of snow-covered mountains emerging out of the mist. Perhaps people will take that as metaphor for hope at the end of this damp squid.\" It's not good when you're hoping the psychopath might actually kill the teenager and put us all out of our misery.",

A whole crew of people with their equipment is standing in front of a person pretending they are not there and trying to inhabit a character different than themselves. When all the work is finally done, an audience watches and hopefully is transported away and into a story in an experience similar to a trance. In a really successful film, there are many artists who are considered for the \"technical awards\" and The Dig is one of those, but let me write about one actor.\nAs an audience, we know instantly when acting is done poorly but sometimes I fear we miss when it is performed so well that it is invisible. Ralph Fiennes (he is Welsh and everyone by now should know - pronounced like Rafe Fines) delivers a performance that is so complete that it is as close to perfection as anything I've ever seen. There is not a millisecond where he is not this \"excavator\". He portrays a simple man who is very complex. He appears to be a common farmer…",

The characters have flaws, but most real life young adults are pretty good people and aren't boiling over with so much drama that they end up yelling at each other before kissing each other in a thunderstorm. I think it had more emotional depth for the lack of heightened drama, not less, and is challenging cinema norms in a very needed way. Not all of film needs to be soap opera and Shakespearian theater. There is a place for grounded portrayal of ordinary people, because in the end real life is bigger than our imaginations. When Hollywood is drowning us in fake or cheap drama, this has the potential to be revolutionary. I hope it has influence.",

It had me from engaged from beginning to end and the actors did a great job. You have war films, and you have films about AI but I think this may be the closest or the most you are going to get when you marry a good modern war film mixed with futuristic technology (AI) without it coming off as cheesy or ridiculous. It is very realistic in a sense when you consider Tech & Warfare. With the heightened concern about the tensions between the modern day superpowers of the world (US and Russia), the groups that try to resist their ideologies over the many years and how it affects those that innocently live or try to survive in between their influences or advancements; this film touches a nerve. Plenty of action, its rugged, and many can relate in some way about its philosophy because we all have that 'What if..?feeling in the back of our minds and I think this film delivers a good plausible answer to the main question.",

It's a really intriguing plot that I was looking forward to experiencing on the big screen, so I headed down to the theatre on Easter Sunday (sacrilegious, I know), and I was honestly pretty excited. And I'm proud to announce that this movie is akin to a religious experience, because when the credits rolled I prayed for forgiveness for wasting my time watching such a mediocre movie.\"The Unholy\" isn't a bad film - it's just painfully average and generic. It has a goldmine at its disposal with its clever premise, and instead it throws every good idea by the wayside to instead fill its running time with cheap jump scares and lazy exposition.

Then I see that this has Morgan Freeman. I decided to give this a try. I blame wasting ninety minutes on Freeman. He tricked me. I was also a little intrigued to see what Ruby Rose was doing after Batwoman. It's obvious that the director had watched way too much John Woo. He's trying to do 90's Woo but lacks the skills. He even pulls a homage to doves. This movie really struggles right from the start with two confused boring scenes. It's trying to set up something but the movie really only needs to start with Freeman and Ruby Rose. That's the start and the rest should be her as John Wick or second rate John Wick which is probably the most that could be hoped for. This movie is derivative and flawed.",

Aja does another movie that is in a tight place .. even tighter than the last one he did with the crocodiles (or is alligators? I always mix those up).Amazing performance by the lead actress. Say what you want about him or his films, but he really knows how to do psychological horror ... this is well thought of and makes sense overall if you take the Science Fiction parts into account. We're not anywhere near freezing people for their safety ... for whatever reasons.The guessing game is there and you may like where this heads or be appalled/annoyed by it. I dug what this did - another good Aja then.",

The second was already meh and now the third is the worst one in my opinion.Sure, the scenery was lovely, the actors were the same sweet people we were used to and they kind of had a logical storyline. But. It was boring, it really was. I wanted to enjoy this, but instead I found myself thinking of other movies I should watch instead, other feel-good entertaining movies. This was not very entertaining to me unfortunately.",

      "review": "Overall, I found Without Remorse disappointing. While a mediocre action film that was mildly entertaining, this was not by any imagination an adaptation of Tom Clancy's Without Remorse.Probably one of Clancy's finest books, Sheridan and Staples manage to shred anything remotely close to the novel. Rather than a realistic portrayal of a man filled with rage and bent on revenge as he walks the tightrope between self-destruction and duty, we get a stylized military version of John Wick.Don't get me wrong, I love the John Wick movies. They're entertaining fun not to take too seriously. Without Remorse (the movie) hits those same notes. But that's not why Clancy fans have waited decades to see this story come to the screen.But if this movie hits the same John Wick notes, then why is it mildly entertaining? The film takes itself seriously, and it is hard to accept. Not too mention some questionable choices from the writers and director that are just hard to swallow.Poor logistical choices…",

      "review": "Such a sad state for us cinema-lovers. But I'll take what I can get, I guess. This movie borrows so heavily from Lord of the Flies that it might consider being renamed Co-ed Lord of the Flies in Space. There was one injured adult and when he was dead the smoldering silent and sensitive protagonist continued to try and maintain order until the power hungry jerk took the conch shell from him. And the young lady who represented the role formerly known as Piggy met a similar demise when she kept nagging everyone to stop misbehaving. Highly unoriginal. I guess there really are only about 6 or 7 story lines in cinema that just keep recycling over and over... Otherwise, from the beginning the Voyagers story is too big and ambitious and, thus, cannot make sense of all the questions that a story like this arises. Like who the hell would ever consider sending kids into space without a team of adult mentors to guide them? And not just one lonely Colin Farrell. Who still looks HOT as heck, btw. And why do they keep saying the first generation won't live to see the new planet when the trip is only 80 years and the kids are only 8 years old when they start out? And why is Brann Stark reprising his role as the 3-eyed Raven in this movie? On the plus side Lily- Rose Depp is adorable and she and Tye Sheridan had chemistry.",

Today many films based on the truth you find Directors selecting an actor who at least resembles the person they are portraying and this is what I see when I watch Andra Day playing Billie Holiday.\nBoth these artists are great singers in their genre but Diana Ross has a much sweeter tone in her vocal not to mention that she also has a much wider range which in truth the…",

Well played, great script, awesome cinematography, great lighting, nice plot (although I was expecting a somewhat darker ending). It's one of those movies they simply can't seem to produce in Hollywood, meaning this movie doesn't need the endless explosions, sex-scenes, people shooting each other, and flying cars colliding in the air that a typical Hollywood movie always has to offer as its main attraction. Oxygen has the intelligence that most Hollywood produced movies just seem to be lacking. Also explains the somewhat lower rating, as it probably doesn't meet the low expectations of the typical US based viewer. Guess too many people out there are so used watching nothing but endless repeating garbage. Ah well, you're never too old to learn.

Although nothing spectacular, and very predictable, the great casting and performances - particularly Timberlake and Allen, elevated the films messages in a subtle and thought-provoking way.

It stars Carey Mulligan as landowner Edith Pretty and Ralph Fiennes as the self-taught archaeologist-excavator Basil Brown, both of them gave strong performances.\nThe English countryside is its own character, as the film wouldn't be as amazing if they wouldn't have shown off the gorgeous scenery. The cinematography is incredible, it's beautiful shot with natural lightning, indoors and outdoors are stunning.\nThe screenplay and overall writing is mostly good, even great at times. But I felt the movie didn't need a romantic storyline that isn't historical accurate, the big changes to Peggy Piggott is another thing I didn't really like as she is supposed to have been an experienced archaeologist and had studied archaeology, for an example. The age difference for some of the actors is something I can look past except for Peggy's husband which should be two years older.The musical score is simple but touching, with its piano and other instruments, Stefan Gregory created a phenomenal score that's so fitting to the film.Archeology is something I have always been interested in and seeing a film doing it in a realistic way was life. I knew nothing of the Sutton Hoo excavation before watching this film, and after doing some research I'm glad Netflix distributed it and gave Simon Stone the chance to direct it, amazing direction and a great film. The Dig is a must watch if you're a fan of historical drama's or interested in archeology.",

It's character driven and focuses on actual relationships rather than stereotypes or current political issues. Even the villain is someone you can sympathize with! The pacing felt great and the acting natural. So much better than the shoot 'em up typical action films.",

He's acted brilliantly for so long and I don't mean to undermine anything he's ever accomplished in the past, but normally by now actors start phoning it in. But wow. He was not.This film was devastating to watch. In the best way possible. From the acting - which was lead by Hopkins but was not just great because of him! - to the writing, directing, scoring, editing, cinematography on and on and on everything was amazing! The only reason I did not give it a perfect 10/10 is because I so rarely give them out I'm afraid to act too rashly and give it out too soon but trust me... I may end up doing just that.As someone who has experienced the subject matter of this film personally in my family I cannot express how painfully accurate every little detail was in the writing and in Hopkins' beautiful performance.

Chris Rock and Samuel L Jackson essentially play themselves, but their comedic quips don't detract from their believable participation in the cop-killer mystery. In fact, their comedic chops lend well to the campy ridiculousness inherent to the Saw series.Chris's story is also very in line with Saw's typical social commentary, and the twist villain is very fitting for the film. While not a perfect movie by any means, Spiral is a fun, welcome entry to the horror franchise and leaves me hopeful for even more future entries with the same amount of love put in.",

      "review": "I liked it. it was a nicely old fashioned detective story. Actually it had the touch of \"True Detective\" and would probably have made a great Season 4. It contains many elements of the famous TV show and I think giving us more time to look at the characters, to emphasize more on several plot elements would have done good to the story because thats where it mostly lacks a little bit.\nThe acting is superb. Now you've got 3 Oscar winning actors in the main roles, the expectations are high but I think absolutely flufilled.\nDenzel Washington is fantastic in the leading role, its a typical Washington role but again he adds something really special to it. Especially in the scenes when he is facing is past. Great work.\nRami Malek got a lot of criticism for his performance, being too wooden, lacking emotionality, etc. I think thats exactly what his character is all about and that he absolutely captured it perfectly. I go even so far and say he gave the best performance in the film. His attitiude was unconventional but so was his character. Jared Leto was absolutely psycho and creepy. He did that well but needs to be careful to to get typecast in that kind of roles. But yeah he was really great.\nThe biggest issue lie in editing and direction in general . While the screenplay surely hd potential (also by John Lee Hancock) I think his direction really lacked. The score by Thomas Newman was good and so was the cinematography, actually one of the best elements. I was not a fan of the ending, I appreciate the conclusion of what the film tries to tell but still was a bit lazy at the end. Otherwise, good atmospheric crime thriller.",

      "review": "From the first 5 minutes you can tell that this is a movie trying to impress you. The black and white film to make it look edgy and the non stop dialogue to create a sense of a face pace. Ok fine, I was able to accept it and continued to watch.Then at about the 10 minute mark my eyes started to ache, like I was wearing a pair of coke bottle glasses. I paid attention more and realized that the camera is continually 6\" to 12\" from the characters at times. The entire face is filled by the screen when they are kissing. And so on, and so on. Always with the zoom.There is no reason for this. Writer/Director Sam Levinson is just trying to create something different and it fails incredibly bad.I'm not sure how anyone doesn't notice this, it's impossible to miss once you see it.",

      "review": "Given the subject matter, this movie is an unflinching, unvarnished, uncompromising look into the life and revolutionary thought of Fred Hampton.For those who are unfamiliar with Fred Hampton, during the time of the Chicago 7, in the late Sixties, Fred Hampton was the leader of the Black Panthers (not of course to be confused with the recent movie, Black Panther) of Chicago. Long before the term was fashionable, Hampton was able to forge what he called a rainbow coalition with other brown and white revolutionary groups, which no doubt hastened his death. In December 1969 he was shot dead while he sleeping by members of the Chicago Police and FBI. There is no historical disagreement that J. Edgar Hoover personally directed the assassination of Fred Hampton. None of the participants were prosecuted nor even questioned following his assassination.The story is told through the eyes of the Judas, the traitor in the organization, Bill O'Neil, and his FBI handler. In life, O'Niel was Fred…",

      "rating": 8,
      "review": "As a huge fan of Chris Rock and a huge fan of the 'Saw' series, when I heard that Rock was behind the revamped 'Spiral' movie we were getting I was beyond excited. Then a worldwide pandemic came along delaying the film by 12 months which only served to get my anticipation levels up that little bit higher. The end product is an interesting one. It's better in some ways than I hoped, and less so in others than what I hoped.What really took me by surprise the most was how much I liked Rock as the lead. Early on we get a little stand-up routine from him (in context of the movie of course - more or less) and then here and there we get little glimpses of his terrific humour which he has obviously inserted into the script himself. But when it's time to get serious he is more than capable. He brings great intensity to the movie and combining that with his natural charisma, makes for a great centrepiece of the film.The film takes a little bit of a step-back in terms of the brutality of some of the traps. Make no mistake, there are some brutal things to watch in this movie, however I suspect a conscious effort was made to reign things in just a little. In previous 'Saw' movies it felt like they were going out of their way to make as many audience members faint as possible. Here is just feels like they are trying to find a good balance between keeping the gore-enthusiasts pleased, and keeping those less inclined to enjoy that type of thing in the cinema.The pacing of the film is lightning quick. There's a little bit of set-up and character introductions early on, but once the action begins it never relents. The film is only 93 minutes admittedly, however it is over before you know it.There's a new voice on the tapes this time around. At first it took me off-guard and I didn't quite know what to think of it. However by the end of the film it had grown on me a lot. It is very different to the one we had in the original series. I will be interested to hear what other people thought of it. I can see it being quite a polarising thing.I won't get into the conclusion of the film (always a treat in the 'Saw/Spiral' universe), suffice to say it is quite different to how we are used to these films ending. I still think I need to go back and rewatch the final scene to fully understand certain character's motivations and what they were trying to achieve. The door has been left wide open for more sequels though so if this one is a success then prepare yourself for Spiral 2-8 in the coming years. I say bring them on.",

Action movies are aspirational for the audience, but the message is lost to its primary demographic. It seems like the producers had a list of boxes to check and filled them without regard for the actual source. I'm only 1:20 into this and it's lost my attention. The plot is playing all the right tropes, so it's easily predictable. The only reason I'm continuing with it is to see, if and how John Kelly morphs into Mr. Clark.

During fighting sequences, the VFX and other special effects look like they're done by a film school student who progresses poorly. The casting is poorly done. How could Ben Falcone cast an Oscar winner in a poorly made film? Everything from pre-production to post-production was rushed, which is unacceptable in Hollywood. This film deserves multiple Razzies, including Worst Picture, Worst Director for Ben Falcone, Worst Actress for Melissa McCarthy, Worst Supporting Actress for Octavia Spencer, and Worst Screenplay. I strongly don't recommend you to watch again.",

      "review": "One of my all time favorite movies is Charlie Kaufman's Synecdoche, New York which narrates the ever deteriorating world around a playwright bordering on reality and insanity. And Florian Zeller's The Father is the closest I've seen that captures the insanity of the decaying mind, but told through the apparatus of a very real and universal issue.The movie was unsettling from start to finish... in the best way possible. It's one that shows the unstable world around the aging Anthony, but with the underlying vigilance that what's \"wrong\" is not necessarily the world around him. And the horror of one's rationality clinging on to his very last bit of sanity is shown in the most surprisingly human way possible, and it's what makes The Father one of the finest movies of the year.Special credits to stars Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman, who undoubtedly make the movie as every bit emotional and human. And Hopkins' performance in this movie is by far my favorite of the year. Overall, a very…",

It's good but you can tell that Liam is getting a little tired and just might be getting too old-I think he is around 68-to be doing action movies. He plays a rancher that lives on the border of Arizona & Mexico-his wife died recently of cancer so he lives alone-and he sees a lot of people sneaking across the border. In fact, he has a walkie talkie that he calls the Border Patrol on whenever he spots any trespassers-they are even on a first name basis. Katheryn plays Liam's daughter that is in Law Enforcement herself. Liam comes across Jacob and his mother crossing over and so he calls his Border Buddies. But before they can show up, Liam runs into Antonio & his friends-who happen to be Mexican Cartel members-looking for Jacob & his mother. The mother doesn't survive the encounter but she does make Liam promise to take Jacob to some relatives in Chicago. From there, the chase is on. Can Liam outrun the Cartel and make it to Chicago, without spreading too much carnage and dead bodies along the way?\nIt's not a bad movie but it's no 'Taken'.\nIt's rated \"PG-13\" for violence, bloody images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 48 minutes.\nI enjoyed it enough that I would probably buy it on DVD.",

I loved the strong horror violence and gore, but some scenes were just really disturbing and i'm talking about some of the scenes in this film that involve the inbred cannibals in sexual situations that absolutely no one would ever care to see, not even the sickest people on the planet. Henry Rollins did a good job as the ex-marine who would stop at nothing to take down the psychos and Erica Leerhsen did a good job too. I give this one a 7 out of 10 because it was good, but it could have done without some of the scenes that I was discussing up above. I would recommend this film to all horror movie fans, but I wouldn't recommend it to those who are disturbed or sickened easily, definitely not for the weak stomached.",

      "rating": 9,
      "review": "When I started watching an Oscar movie with the incomparable Sir Anthony Hopkins I didn't know what \"I'm getting into\"!The Father -2020 is a film that does not make you feel good but makes you deeply sad, it makes you go through all the possible states and even makes you think that ... you never know what fate is preparing for you!Quite static (taking place in 3-4 rooms and a long hallway) the film becomes dynamic due to the fact that the action takes place, in fact, in the ravaged mind of a father with Alzheimer's.Incredible and terrifying is the illustration in images of the darkness in the mind of a confused man: the plans overlap, the rooms change, the characters are or are not what they seem ... everything is unclear ... and in the center of all is always him, the old man with a confused and confusing smile on his lips.I don't think he would have been another better actor for this role. Even the writer / director Florian Zeller didn't think otherwise, offering the script since 2017 to the great actor and refusing to make the film without him (the character's name is Athony because it can only be his) Ffff inspired choice because Hopkins is masterful! Merit that was recognized this year with an Oscar (the actor has another for Silence of the Lambs - 1991) being the oldest actor who received this distinction at 84, dethroning him (if you can say that even though everyone has well-established place in the panoply of great actors as well as in our hearts) Christopher Plummer who was awarded at the age of 82.Olivia Colman (as Anne's daughter) is slightly overshadowed by Hopkins' overwhelming personality (who wouldn't she be ?!) yet she plays a wonderful role.The film also has parts in which music plays an important role, Hopkins being a great lover of classical music and even singing the piano. The area from Bizet's \"Pearl Fishermen\" was chosen for the film at his suggestion, being one of his favorites.I don't think there is much more to say about this film (it \"took my maul\" anyway as they say) and I don't even know if it would be good to recommend it to people who have old or sick parents or to young people who don't he would (still) understand its depth.\"The Father\" is such a realistic movie that it's good to put on a list and watch only when you have the necessary mood but ... by no means ignored!",

How this film ever got out of the block I will never know.The original Wrong Turn from 2003 was a genuinely atmospheric horror, with both suspense and characters to the fore. You can tell just how bad WT2 is by the fact that the first grisly murder takes place within five minutes of the film starting.We are then plunged into the middle of a reality TV show involving six - or is it seven? - celebrities. Henry Rollins pops up as a US Marine, brought in to 'kick ass' while the various celebrities bicker and squabble as they are paired off and then go off into the woods to see if they can survive more than half-an-hour without a Mars bars, a mobile phone, or a roll of toilet paper.So far so good, and I will admit I did almost enjoy the first thirty minutes.

A friend of mine asked me to watch Sam Levinson's film Malcolm & Marie, to provide her with some depth to understand the film as she couldn't make sense of it. This review is strictly my own opinion.The use of black & white and one location places emphasis on the characters and their emotions. The isolation of the characters from the outside world makes it very intimate, private and timeless. This makes the viewer feel like an intruder, but also demands the viewers attention throughout the film.The modern fancy lifestyle portrayed is the \"mask\" they wear in public, how they want the world to see them. The \"American dream\" however there is some disturbing emtional depth to these characters.\nMarie and Malcolm portrays each others inner demons.As they talk to each other the viewers get to know each character so well that it becomes uncomfortable to watch because we all have demons to fight within ourselves and this is…",

It makes me think that people can't think outside the box; that they were not able to make an accurate connection between the events in this movie and the altered mental status of a hardcore addict who suffers from cognitive distortion and other mental symptoms caused by excessive drug usage. This movie used symbolism in an ingenious way. If one analyzes this movie, one can see the correlation between the specific events and the effects certain drugs have on the mind and body.

She plays a character who was Britains's best archaeologist: you wouldn't know it from this storyline.So much more could have been explained, and we would have loved it.

Its poorly written, very poorly directed, poorly scripted, poorly choreographed, and poorly shot.There is really not point going into details, but if you want to know how not to make a film, or if your a lecturer highlighting the poor use of resources for film making to your students, you could well use this as a great example.Cage has no lines in this film, and I mean NONE, and if you are going to make a film where the lead character has no lines, it had better be a fantastic screenplay, This most certainly isn't and the attempt at a quirky implementation falls completely flat.I'd say see it just for the experience, but even that would be a waste of time.",

As other have noted, it makes this unwatchable (I started to fast-forward about 90 minutes in).The production itself - despite its voyeuristic obsession with sex and violence - looks like it came from Disney. I feel disgusted to use this word, but it has been whitewashed beyond comprehension.Andra Day gives a credible performance and does an decent imitation of Holiday's voice, but it's all technique and no soul.I can speak with some authority on the disarray of her life: for 12 years I worked for the record company which owns the rights to a huge amount of her prime recordings, and the first that issued a 10-CD box when digital technology was new.

It's only by around the end of the first hour that Jared Leto's character Albert Sparma is brought into the picture. Throughout the runtime, the film insists that it's the little things that are important and conveys a theme that everybody has skeletons in their closet.

It obviously wasn't going to be a love story, and pretty much the entire trailer they were arguing aswell.This movie was very well written, and wow the acting was incredible. Zendaya's and Washington's performance is what makes this movie what it is, is was so... perfect. From the monologues to them just sitting silent next to eachother, it was all perfect, and the best acting I've seen in a while.",

So, even though I tried to keep my expectations here as low as possible to avoid being disappointed much, I still hoped for good. Like Agent Mulder? I wanted to believe. Unfortunately... yeah. You know how it is. Didn't happen. Like... at all.First of all, it's exactly as forced as you may expect. Every single scene and every single line here screams \"forced\". The original Coming to America was daring, it was fresh and, well, it was... you know... FUN. This? It's just a forced mess. One of those movies that you forget right after you're done watching.

      "review": "Cherry 2000 was interesting for many reasons, not least for the unusual location for part of it. The name Sky Ranch was used, and this represents a place that actually exists. The headquarters of the bad guys, which was called Sky Ranch in the film, was actually what remained of Ash Meadows Sky Ranch, a permanently closed Nevada brothel. Until it closed in 1973 or 1974, Ash Meadows was considered one of the best of Nevada's legal brothels. The closest town was Death Valley Junction, which is in California. A dirt and gravel road was all there was to connect to Ash Meadows, and a billboard marked the turn, advertising free coffee.The brothel itself featured a small motel, a pool (seen in the movie), a 9-hole golf course, and an air strip, which might still appear on civilian aviation charts.Some time after the brothel closed, the State of Nevada made it a landmark of some sort, and I believe it takes special permission to enter.If not for Cherry 2000, I would never have been able to…",

I wonder sometimes how such a movie gets produced (like, how did Michael Nesmith get Repo Man out of the Hollywood grinder?).My DVD front cover lists Melanie Griffith and Ben Johnson but not David Andrews, who was excellent. A more well-known male lead would not have worked (in my opinion). Tim Thomerson's part is memorable. I enjoy the sci-fi back-references such as the cameo by the original GORT, a sci-fi tradition.I rate it a 7.5/10, I put it on the same shelf as Legally Blond, and I play it when I just want G-rated…",

The genre for this film is \"Action, Sci-Fi, Thriller\" but also needs \"Comedy\" added because Grillo made us laugh throughout his entire performances, especially during his commentating dialogue. The entire casting and performances were spot on. Writer, producer and director Joe Carnahan was genius with his screenplay, although I'm sure some critics will slam this film as a Ground Hog Day knockoff. But considering every type of story these days isn't original, Carnahan managed to make this one unique and as far as I'm concerned, less monotonous and much more fun than Ground Hog Day. The 100 min runtime was just right as was the pacing. Carnahan's directing was excellent as was the cinematography. The score was perfect and the soundtrack amazing! This is one I'll be seeing again and adding to my DVD collection! Thanks Hulu for picking this one up!",

John Clark is supposed to kick butt and while MBJ had moments I blame the lackluster script. Adding LT Commander Karen Greer as a character also was offensive and ruined any realism. There are currently NO female Navy Seals, much less a team lead reasonably high officer. Her character was pure Hollywood to be able to say they added a black woman. Every time she was on screen, it took me out of the movie and reminded me that \"politically correct\" was more important than a good movie.

The male star goes on a quest to replace his lost robot sex android. That's the basic plot.What's unusual is that this movie succeeds in mixing these elements without screwing up. The Sci-fi perspective doesn't overwhelm the overall plot, and vice versa.Very few B grade movies from this time period were watchable, much less worth keeping in one's collection. Fortunately, Cherry 2000 bucked this trend and deserves a spot on the shelf of any cult classic and/or Sci-fi movie collector.",

I think that all the people that see this piece only as a two-hour fight just fail to see the emotional journey that this film takes us through. I personally as a person that has been in a toxic relationship can really relate to many things I saw.\nAnother thing that i find so good about this film is that you don't know what's coming next. It is not predictable. I also laughed.. but because it was sad.\nI admired Zendaya before this movie, now even more so.

      "review": "As a teenager today I could really empathize with Michaels struggles of friendship, love, and passion. I felt his pain and anxiety throughout the whole movie but at the same time could see both sides of the argument between his friends and family. Not only that but a lot of the things Micheal experienced I somewhat experienced myself, the troubles of having a girlfriend and a best friend at the same time, having your family want you to do something you didn't wanna do and drifting away from close friends. Near the end when Micheal and Adolf made up and hugged I teared up a bit because something exactly the same happened to me once but me and my past friend never made up so it really made me think of him and how we both should have changed and learned and grew together. I also could feel Michaels passion to be cool and hangout with pros and having a friend who is just a loser, again I went through the same thing. I could really tell that the people making this movie understood being a skater and being a teenager and how tough it is. I also thought that the actor was superb, Vince Vaughn and the lead cast did incredible in their roles and I could feel the tension while watching. The only critiques I really have are from a director stand point like how some of the scenes are a little misplaced or filmed funny. In all I loved this movie and have already watched it twice today. I recommend it to anyone who is or once was a skater in their teen years.",

No words, no explanation to his character except punches, kicks and final blows, Cage is at his best doing exactly what you love to see him do. While he's known for award winning and AAA blockbuster performances, I always enjoy seeing him in projects no one but him would accept and pull to their best potential. In recent years, Mom and Dad, Mandy & Color out of space really gained points with his mere presence, and boy does he shine when he's having fun. On par with those, this is a refreshing flick and I'm really hoping we keep seeing more pop up from time to time.

But it got our curiosity up, so, with low expectations, we gave it a watch. I guess we just aren't as smart as the critics, because we both enjoyed it. None of the criticisms the critics made (i.e. overacting, stiff acting, poor dialog) was valid to us. I'm wondering if one particular scene that was rather critical of a movie critic simply ticked the real critics off, so they were trying to exact their revenge.Anyone who's been in a serious relationship could likely relate to the feelings the actors portrayed, and the amount of dialog they needed to perform was astounding. For us, even though the movie featured only 2 people in a conversation over the course of one long night, it held our attention. Certainly this film was much better than the most recent one Denzel gave us. Count us among those who enjoyed this.",
